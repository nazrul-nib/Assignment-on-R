"1","29439305","Strategic Application of Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","With increasing clinical use, radiotherapy (RT) has been considered reliable and effective method for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, depending on extent of disease and patient characteristics. RT for HCC can improve therapeutic outcomes through excellent local control, downstaging, conversion from unresectable to resectable status, and treatments of unresectable HCCs with vessel invasion or multiple intrahepatic metastases. In addition, further development of modern RT technologies, including image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and stereotactic body radiotherapy, has expanded the indication of RT. An essential feature of IGRT is that it allows image guidance therapy through in-room images obtained during radiation delivery. Compared with 3D-conformal RT, distinctions of IMRT are inverse treatment planning process and use of a large number of treatment fields or subfields, which provide high precision and exquisitely conformal dose distribution. These modern RT techniques allow more precise treatment by reducing inter- and intra-fractional errors resulting from daily changes and irradiated dose at surrounding normal tissues. More recently, particle therapy has been actively investigated to improve effectiveness of RT. This review discusses modern RT strategies for HCC, as well as optimal selection of RT in multimodal approach for HCC.","Clinical and molecular hepatology",NA,NA

The most common secondary malignancy of the pancreas is renal cell carcinoma. We report a patient presented with abdominal pain and weight loss. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed pancreatic head mass. Biopsy from the mass showed prostate metastasis after 13 years from radical prostatectomy and Leuprolide therapy. This case demonstrates a rare location for prostate metastasis which was the pancreas. To our knowledge there are only six cases reported in literature. Due to increased long-term survival of prostate cancer patients, the frequency of metastases to the pancreas will likely increase. Therefore, clinicians need to be aware the pancreatic tumor may be secondary to an extrapancreatic malignancy.","South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association","71","1"

Recent studies suggest that BHD accounts for up to 10% of all SP in adults and BHD in children with SP have been reported.METHODS: To explore to what extent BHD is the cause of childhood pneumothorax, we studied a Danish BHD cohort consisting of 109 cases from 22 families. Clinical data was gathered by review of medical records. A systematic literature search concerning childhood and adolescence pneumothorax in BHD was performed and identified publications reviewed.RESULTS: In our cohort, three of 109 BHD cases experienced childhood pneumothorax, corresponding to a prevalence of 3%. Reviewing the literature, data regarding more than 800 BHD cases were covered. Only seven previously published cases of childhood pneumothorax in BHD were identified.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that BHD is likely the cause of a larger subset of childhood pneumothoraces than hitherto recognized. Awareness of BHD as a cause of childhood pneumothorax needs to be raised to provide patients and relatives with the possibility of specialized management of SP and regular renal cancer surveillance.","Molecular genetics &amp; genomic medicine",NA,NA

The objective of this multicenter, randomized, controlled study was to compare the accuracy with which magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) and indigo carmine chromoendoscopy delineate EGC margins.METHODS:  Patients with EGC<U+200A>=<U+200A>10<U+200A>mm undergoing endoscopic or surgical resection were enrolled. The oral-side margins of the lesions were first evaluated with conventional white-light endoscopy in both groups and then delineated by either chromoendoscopy or M-NBI. Biopsies were taken from noncancerous and cancerous mucosa, each at 5<U+200A>mm from the margin. Accurate delineation was judged to have been achieved when the histological findings in all biopsy samples were consistent with endoscopic diagnoses. The primary end point was the difference in rate of accurate delineation between the two techniques.CONCLUSIONS:  M-NBI does not offer superior delineation of EGC margins compared with chromoendoscopy; the two methods appear to be clinically equivalent.","Endoscopy",NA,NA

The aim of this study was to examine the functional role of PRAME in HCC development and exploring the molecular mechanism.METHODS: We first detected PRAME expression in 96 human HCC tissue samples and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of the patients. We then established stable HCC cell lines with PRAME overexpression and knockdown followed by functional analysis in vitro. Further, we examined the relationship between PRAME and p53 pathway in vitro by using Western blotting. Finally, PRAME expression was detected to evaluate its correlation with p-p53 and p53 pathway related apoptotic proteins in xenograft tumor mouse model using immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: PRAME expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues and their expression was positively correlated with alpha fetoprotein levels and tumor size. In addition, PRAME expression was associated with AJCC stage and is a potential biomarker of poor prognosis regarding 5-year overall survival in HCC. In vitro studies, we found that PRAME expression was higher in HCC cell lines than in normal hepatic cell line. Inhibited cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis was observed in PRAME knockdown HCC cells. Futher, increased cell apoptosis was correlated with the proportion of cells in G0/G1 stage, activated p53 mediated apoptosis, and increased cyclin p21 expression. Xenograft analysis in nude mice also found that PRAME knockdown inhibited tumorigenesis while PRAME overexpression had opposite effect.CONCLUSIONS: In HCC, PRAME serves as a potential biomarker for poor prognosis and novel therapeutic target in treating this cancer. PRAME is a potential biomarker of poor prognosis in HCC. PRAME surpresses HCC cell death in vitro and in vivo by regulating p53 apoptotic signaling and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in HCC.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology","45","3"

Bone marrow stem cells believed to have anticancer potential and are preferred for their activities by stimulating the immune system, migration to the site of tumor and ability for inducting apoptosis in cancer cells. The current study was aimed to investigate the tumor suppressive effects of bone marrow cells (BMCs) in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer in rats.METHODS: The rats were randomly allocated into four groups: control, BMCs alone, DMH alone and BMCs with DMH. BMCs were injected intrarectally while DMH was injected subcutaneously at 20 mg/kg body weight once a week for 15 weeks. Histopathological examination and gene expression of survivin, ß-catenin and multidrug resistance-1 (MDR-1) by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in rat colon tissues. This is in addition to oxidative stress markers in colon were performed across all groups.RESULTS: The presence of aberrant crypt foci was reordered once histopathological examination of colon tissue from rats which received DMH alone. Administration of BMCs into rats starting from zero-day of DMH injection improved the histopathological picture which showed a clear improvement in mucosal layer, few inflammatory cells infiltration periglandular and in the lamina propria. Gene expression in rat colon tissue demonstrated that BMCs down-regulated survivin, ß-catenin, MDR-1 and cytokeratin 20 genes expression in colon tissues after colon cancer induction. Amelioration of the colon status after administration of MSCs has been evidenced by a major reduction of lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and increasing of glutathione content and superoxide dismutase along with catalase activities.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that BMCs have tumor suppressive effects in DMH-induced colon cancer as evidenced by down-regulation of survivin, ß-catenin, and MDR-1 genes and enhancing the antioxidant activity.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology","45","3"

The purpose of this study was to explore the prognostic biological markers of OC.METHODS: Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify genes related to OC prognosis from the Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) database. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyse the level of SPINK13 in OC and normal tissues. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion were performed using MTT assay, flow cytometric analysis and Transwell assay, respectively.RESULTS: We identified the Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor-13 (SPINK13) gene related to OC prognosis from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database by univariate Cox regression analysis. Overexpression of SPINK13 was associated with higher overall survival rate in OC patients. Immunohistochemistry showed that the level of SPINK13 protein was significantly lower in OC tissues than in normal tissues (P &lt; 0.05).In vitro experiments showed that the overexpression of SPINK13 inhibited cellular proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, SPINK13 inhibited cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). SPINK13 was found to inhibit the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), while recombinant uPA protein could reverse the inhibitory effect of SPINK13 on OC metastasis.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that SPINK13 functions as a tumour suppressor. The role of SPINK13 in cellular proliferation, apoptosis and migration is uPA dependent, and SPINK13 may be used as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and targeted therapy in OC.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology","45","3"

We used chronic in vivo imaging and followed genetically labeled individual NSPCs and their progeny in the mouse hippocampus for up to 2 months. We show that NSPCs targeted by the endogenous Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1) promoter undergo limited rounds of symmetric and asymmetric divisions, eliciting a burst of neurogenic activity, after which they are lost. Further, our data reveal unexpected asymmetric divisions of nonradial glia-like NSPCs. Cell fates of Ascl1-labeled lineages suggest a developmental-like program involving a sequential transition from a proliferative to a neurogenic phase. By providing a comprehensive description of lineage relationships, from dividing NSPCs to newborn neurons integrating into the hippocampal circuitry, our data offer insight into how NSPCs support life-long hippocampal neurogenesis.","Science (New York, N.Y.)","359","6376"

The polymerization state of F-actin is important during assembly, ingression, disassembly, and closure of the contractile ring and for the cytoskeletal remodeling that accompanies midbody formation and progression to abscission. Actin filaments must be cleared from the abscission sites before the final cut can take place. Although many conserved proteins interact with and influence the polymerization state of actin filaments, it is poorly understood how they regulate cytokinesis in higher eukaryotes. We report here that the actin capping protein (CP), a barbed end actin binding protein, participates in the control of actin polymerization during later stages of cytokinesis in human cells. Cells depleted of CP furrow and form early midbodies, but they fail cytokinesis. Appropriate recruitment of the ESCRT-III abscission machinery to the midbody is impaired, preventing the cell from progressing to the abscission stage. To generate actin filaments of optimal length, different actin nucleators, such as formins, balance CP's activity. Loss of actin capping activity leads to excessive accumulation of formin-based linear actin filaments. Depletion of the formin FHOD1 results in partial rescue of CP-induced cytokinesis failure, suggesting that it can antagonize CP activity during midbody maturation. Our work suggests that the actin cytoskeleton is remodeled in a stepwise manner during cytokinesis, with different regulators at different stages required for successful progression to abscission.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America",NA,NA

In addition to cell intrinsic programs, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells fate decisions are subject to extrinsic cues from within the bone marrow microenvironment and systemically. Yet, many of the paracrine and endocrine mediators that shape hematopoietic function remain to be discovered. Extracellular vesicles serve as evolutionarily conserved, constitutive regulators of cell and tissue homeostasis, with several recent reports supporting a role for extracellular vesicles in the regulation of hematopoiesis. We review the physiological and pathophysiological effects that extracellular vesicles have on bone marrow compartmental function while highlighting progress in understanding vesicle biogenesis, cargo incorporation, differential uptake and downstream effects of vesicle internalization. This review further touches on the role of extracellular vesicles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells fate regulation and recent advances in therapeutic and diagnostic applications of extracellular vesicles in hematological disorders.","Haematologica",NA,NA

Transplant survivors, however, are at an increased risk of chronic health conditions compared with the general population, including the emergence of secondary malignant neoplasms. In particular, female transplant survivors may face a greater risk of lower genital tract (cervical, vulvar, or vaginal) neoplasms due to chronic immune dysregulation in the peritransplant and posttransplant environment. Persistent immune suppression may facilitate the carcinogenesis of human papillomavirus (HPV), the causative agent of nearly all cervical cancers and most vulvar and vaginal cancers. Nevertheless, the risk of these cancers has not been sufficiently quantified in female transplant survivors. Small clinical studies have shown that the rate of cervical cytological abnormalities increases after allogeneic HCT, but large population-based studies have not consistently demonstrated an increased risk of secondary cervical cancer after transplant compared with the general population; the risk of developing secondary vulvar or vaginal cancer after transplant remains unclear. A better understanding of the natural history of HPV-associated lower genital tract neoplasms and their transplant-related risk factors would help delineate optimal long-term follow-up protocols in this population. In this systematic review, we summarize the current literature on this topic and discuss the implications for cervical cancer screening and vaccination in female transplant recipients.","Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN","16","2"

Late effects of CIPN may increase with improved cancer survival.METHODS: Olmsted County, Minnesota residents receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy were identified and CIPN was ascertained via text searches of polyneuropathy symptoms in the medical record. Clinical records were queried to collect data on baseline characteristics, risk factors, signs and symptoms of CIPN, medications, impairments and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnostic codes for all subjects.RESULTS: A total of 509 individuals with incident exposure to an inclusive list of neurotoxic chemotherapy agents between 2006 and 2008 were identified. 268 (52.7%) of these individuals were determined to have CIPN. The median time from incident exposure to first documented symptoms was 71 days. Patients with CIPN received a neuropathy ICD-9 diagnosis in only 37 instances (13.8%). Pain symptoms and use of pain medications were observed more often in patients with CIPN. Five-year survival was greater in those with CIPN (55.2%) versus those without (36.1%). Those with CIPN surviving greater than 5 years (n=145) continued to have substantial impairments and were more likely to be prescribed opioids than those without CIPN (OR 2.0, 1.06-3.69).CONCLUSIONS: Results from our population-based study are consistent with previous reports of high incidence of CIPN in the first 2<U+2009>years following incident exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, and its association with significant pain symptomatology and accompanied long-term opioid use. Increased survival following exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapy and its long-term disease burden necessitates further study among survivors.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",NA,NA

To examine the time trends of liver cancer mortality by gender in urban and rural areas in China, Joinpoint analysis was used to estimate the annual per cent change. The intrinsic estimator, a method of age-period-cohort analysis to estimate age, period and cohort effects simultaneously, was used to analyse the underlying mechanisms for liver cancer mortality trends in the aforementioned four groups.RESULTS: We observed a significant decline in liver cancer mortality for urban men (average annual per cent change (AAPC)=-1.1%, P&lt;0.05) and urban women (AAPC=-1.4%, P&lt;0.05), while the liver cancer mortality remained stable for rural men (AAPC=-0.1%, P&gt;0.05) and rural women (AAPC=-0.9%, P&gt;0.05). Compared with the 15-19 age group, the liver cancer mortality risk of the 85 and above age group increased 65 and 42 times for urban and rural men, and 102 and 70 times for urban and rural women. From the 1990-1994 period to the 2005-2009 period, the risk increased 56% and 92% for urban and rural men, and 30% and 74% for urban and rural women. Compared with period and cohort effects, age effects were the most influential factor in liver cancer mortality.CONCLUSIONS: As the status of ageing population in China gets worse, the burden caused by liver cancer mortality could still be a great challenge for China in the future. The disparity of liver cancer mortality trends between urban and rural residents can be attributed to period effects, referring to the unequal medical levels and resources between urban and rural areas.","BMJ open","8","2"

Secondary outcomes included assessments of registration timing and quality, and the impact of outcome discrepancies between registration and publication on the statistical significance of the included trials.RESULTS: Of 192 included trials, 134 (70%) were positive and 58 (30%) were negative. Financial ties were present between first or last authors and drug manufacturers for 130 trials (68%), of which 78% were positive, versus 53% of trials with no financial ties that were positive. Clearly defined, prospectively registered outcomes that matched the published outcomes were present in just 76 of the 192 trials (40%). After adjusting for study start date and sample size, the observed relationship between investigator financial ties and the presence of a match between prospectively registered and published primary outcomes was of borderline statistical significance (OR 2.12, 95%<U+2009>CI 0.998 to 4.50). Studies with financial ties present were more likely than studies without ties to have been prospectively registered (78%vs48%, P&lt;0.001) and were more likely to have prospectively registered a clearly defined primary outcome(62%vs35%, P&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of the trials in this cohort were prospectively registered with a clear primary outcome that was consistent with the primary outcome reported in the published manuscript. The presence of investigator financial ties was associated with higher quality registration practices, though this association diminished after adjusting for factors that impact registration quality.","BMJ open","8","2"

Despite deleting the word &quot;carcinoma&quot; from its name, NIFTP is not a benign tumor either, and is best regarded as a neoplasm with &quot;very low malignant potential&quot;. The main goal of the introduction of NIFTP category is to prevent overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Sampling constraints, especially when dealing with heterogeneous and/or large nodules, and difficulties in the invasiveness evaluation, are the major weaknesses of the histological characterization of NIFTP. At the cytological level, NIFTP can be separated from classic papillary carcinoma (cPTC) but not from encapsulated, invasive follicular variant PTC. The impact of NIFTP individualization for Cytopathology is the drop of rates of malignancy for each Bethesda category in general, and for indeterminate categories in particular. The biggest impact will be seen in institutions with a high frequency of FVPTC. The introduction of NIFTP has changed the utility of predictive values of molecular tests because RAS mutations and PAX8- PPARg rearrangements are frequently detected in NIFTP. This turns less promising the application of mutation detection panels as indicators of malignancy and will probably contribute to switch to a rule-out approach of molecular testing. Selection for surgery will go on being determined by a combined detection of clinical, cytological and ultrasound suspicious features.","Endocrine-related cancer",NA,NA

We report the application of thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) for high throughput intracellular monitoring of protein complex dynamics. Significant TPCA signatures observed among well-validated protein-protein interactions correlate positively with interaction stoichiometry, and are statistically observable in more than 350 annotated human protein complexes. Using TPCA, we identify many complexes without detectable differential protein expression, including chromatin-associated complexes, modulated in S-phase of the cell cycle. Comparing six cell lines, TPCA reveals cell-specific interactions even in fundamental cellular processes. TPCA constitutes an approach for system-wide studies of protein complexes in non-engineered cells and tissues, and might be used to identify protein complexes that are modulated in diseases.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",NA,NA

Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies with HCQ have shown that drug exposure in the blood does not correlate with autophagy inhibition in either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or tumor tissue. To better explain this PK/PD disconnect a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) was developed for HCQ describing the tissue-specific absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion as well as lysosome-specific sequestration. Using physiologic and biochemical parameters derived from literature or obtained experimentally the model was first developed and validated in mice, and then adapted to simulate human HCQ exposure in whole blood and urine through allometric scaling and species-specific parameter modification. The human model accurately simulated average steady-state concentrations (Css) of those observed in five different HCQ combination clinical trials across seven different doses, which was then expanded by comparison of the Css distribution in a virtual human population at this range of doses. Value of this model lies in its ability to simulate HCQ PK in patients while accounting for PK modification by combination treatment modalities, drug concentrations at the active site in the lysosome under varying pH conditions, and exposure in tissues where toxicity is observed.","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics",NA,NA

In particular, protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been shown to be essential in the signalling cascade that coordinates break repair with cell cycle progression. Here, we performed whole-cell quantitative proteomics to identify global changes in protein ubiquitination that are induced by DNA double-strand breaks. In total, we quantified more than 9400 ubiquitin sites and found that the relative abundance of approximately 10% of these sites was altered in response to DNA double-strand breaks. Interestingly, a large proportion of ribosomal proteins, including those from the 40S as well as the 60S subunit, were ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage. In parallel, we discovered that DNA damage leads to the inhibition of ribosome function. Taken together, these data uncover the ribosome as a major target of the DNA damage response.","Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP",NA,NA

However, how SUMO E1/2/3 complexes use different SUMO isoforms and recognize substrates remains largely unknown.  Using a human proteome microarray-based activity screen, we identified over 2,500 proteins that undergo SUMO E3-dependent SUMOylation.  We next constructed a SUMO isoform- and E3 ligase-dependent enzyme-substrate relationship network. Protein kinases were significantly enriched among SUMOylation substrates, suggesting crosstalk between tyrosine phosphorylation and SUMOylation. Cell-based analyses of tyrosine kinase, PYK2, revealed that SUMOylation at four lysine residues promoted PYK2 autophosphorylation at Tyrsine402, which in turn enhanced its interaction with SRC and full activation of the SRC-PYK2 complex. SUMOylation on WT but not the 4KR mutant of PYK2 further elevated phosphorylation of the downstream components in the focal adhesion pathway, such as paxillin and Erk1/2, leading to significantly enhanced cell migration during wound healing.  These studies illustrate how our SUMO E3 ligase-substrate network can be used to explore crosstalk between SUMOylation and other PTMs in many biological processes.","Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP",NA,NA
"51","29438991","Genetic hitchhiking and population bottlenecks contribute to prostate cancer disparities in men of African descent.","Prostate cancer (CaP) incidence and mortality rates in African and African American men are greatly elevated compared to other ethnicities. This disparity is likely explained by a combination of social, environmental, and genetic factors. A large number of susceptibility loci have been reported by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but the contribution of these loci to CaP disparities is unclear. Here we investigated the population structure of 68 previously reported GWAS loci and calculated Genetic Disparity Contribution (GDC) statistics to identify SNPs that contribute the most to differences in CaP risk across populations. By integrating GWAS results with allele frequency data, we generated Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) for 45 African and 19 non-African populations. Tests of natural selection were used to assess why some SNPs have large allele frequency differences across populations. We report that genetic predictions of CaP risks are highest for West African men and lowest for East Asian men. These differences may be explained by the out-of-Africa bottleneck and natural selection. A small number of loci appear to drive elevated CaP risks in men of African descent including rs9632117, rs6983267, rs10896449, rs10993994, and rs817826. Although most CaP-associated loci are evolving neutrally, there are multiple instances where alleles have hitchhiked to high frequencies with linked adaptive alleles. For example, a protective allele at 2q37 appears to have risen to high frequency in Europe due to selection acting on pigmentation. Our results suggest that evolutionary history contributes to the high rates of CaP in African and African American men.","Cancer research",NA,NA

However, resistance to steroidal inhibitors inevitably develops in patients, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is a nuclear receptor, originally characterized as an important regulator of some liver-specific metabolic genes. Here we report that LRH-1, which exhibited an increased expression pattern in high-grade prostate cancer and CRPC xenograft models, functions to promote de novo androgen biosynthesis via its direct transactivation of several key steroidogenic enzyme genes, elevating intratumoral androgen levels and reactivating AR signaling in CRPC xenografts as well as abiraterone-treated CRPC tumors. Pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 activity attenuated LRH-1-mediated androgen deprivation and antiandrogen resistance of prostate cancer cells. Our findings not only demonstrate the significant role of LRH-1 in the promotion of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in CRPC via its direct transcriptional control of steroidogenesis but also suggest targeting LRH-1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRPC management.","Cancer research",NA,NA

However, how SUMO isopeptidases (SENP) regulate cell mitotic procession is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that precise phosphorylation of SENP3 during mitosis suppresses SENP3 de-SUMOylation activity towards chromosome-associated proteins including Topoisomerase IIa (Topo IIa). Cyclin B-dependent kinases 1 (CDK1) and protein phosphatase 1a (PP1a) were identified as the kinase and phosphatase in control of mitotic SENP3 phosphorylation, respectively. SENP3 phosphorylation decreased its interaction with TopoIIa, resulting in reduced SENP3 de-SUMOylation activity on Topoisomerase IIa. Furthermore, we observed mitotic arrest, increased chromosome instability, and promotion of tumorigenesis in cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable SENP3 mutant. These data show that SENP3 phosphorylation plays a crucial role in regulating the SUMOylation of chromosome-associated proteins as well as chromosome stability in mitosis.","Cancer research",NA,NA

Across the four strikes, there were 31<U+2009>651 fewer admissions (-9.1%), 23<U+2009>895 fewer A&amp;E attendances (-6.8%) and 173<U+2009>462 fewer outpatient appointments (-6.0%) than expected. Additionally, 101<U+2009>109 more outpatient appointments were cancelled by hospitals than expected (+52%). The 26-27 April strike, where emergency services were also affected, showed the largest impacts on regular service. Mortality did not measurably increase on strike days. Regional analysis showed that services in the Yorkshire and the Humber region were disproportionately more affected by the industrial action.CONCLUSIONS: Industrial action by junior doctors during early 2016 caused a significant impact on the provision of healthcare provided by English hospitals.

In vivo, the Th17 cell frequency in the peripheral blood was determined by flow cytometry. Secretion of IL-17 and CXCL1 in the blood serum was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expression of IL-17A and CXCL1 mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR. In vitro, the effects of Th17/CXCL1 during breast cancer were assessed in the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Cell proliferation was measured using the CCK8 assay. Cell invasion and migration ability were assessed using a transwell cell invasion and wound- healing assay. In vivo, Th17 cells and CXCL1 were increased in breast cancer patients. Moreover, their changes were correlated in breast cancer cells. Th17 cells upregulate the production of CXCL1 during breast cancer progression. CXCL1, which is produced by breast cancer cells, can promote cancer growth and development, and may also point to a specific histogenetic pathway.","International immunopharmacology","56",NA

One miRNA has multiple downstream target genes, which can be regulated by multiple upstream other miRNAs. Hence, this dynamic regulation is likely characterized by volatility, and thus, finding the appropriate time point for tests becomes essential for the use of miRNAs as an early marker of tumor diagnosis. In this study, we established a chronic liver cancer progression model in mice by using low doses of the harmful substance microcystin-LR (MC-LR). On the basis of miRNAs microarray assay, we further tested seven miRNAs that showed characteristic expression changes in pre-hepatocarcinogenesis. Our results showed that the levels of four miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-125-5p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-503-5p) decreased dramatically, whereas those of two miRNAs (miR-222-5p and miR-590-5p) increased significantly in the early stages, which were all accompanied by an increase in atypia of hepatocytes. MiR-490-5p was a sensitive molecular, suitable only for evaluation of pathological changes in young mice.

Among the several determinants of this late diagnosis, the most important is the healthcare-seeking behaviour of the oral cancer patients. The aim of this study was to explore the care-seeking behaviour and its determinants among oral cancer patients.METHODS: A face-to-face in-depth interview was conducted among 70 oral cancer patients using a semi-structured questionnaire, and qualitative content analysis of the results was performed.RESULTS: All the patients had squamous-cell carcinoma and none had attended any screening programme. The most common site affected was the buccal mucosa with a non-healing wound. Most of the patients contacted a doctor available nearby; only 7% of patients consulted a dentist. Only one patient approached a traditional healer. The median patient delay was 30 (4-365) days and the professional delay was 40 (4-650) days. Enablers included determinants such as increasing symptoms (80%), influence of the society (74%), fear (10%), and social media (3%). The main barriers were lack of awareness (97%), hope that the lesion will heal spontaneously (90%), lack of perception of seriousness (64%), financial constraints (55%), provider switching (47%), and missed diagnosis (44%).CONCLUSION: The care-seeking path among oral cancer patients is complex, customised, and influenced by multiple patient-related and system-related factors.","Cancer epidemiology","53",NA

We examined risk factors for receipt of inpatient chemotherapy and death during hospitalization.METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2012-2013 HCUP-NIS. We identified patient and hospital characteristics that were associated with chemotherapy administration and death.RESULTS: Chemotherapy was given in 3260/11,150 (29.2%) of hospitalizations. Younger age, urban teaching hospitals, fewer chronic conditions, male sex, non-Medicare insurance, and &quot;less likelihood of dying&quot; were associated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy portended lower odds of death; older age and longer hospitalizations were associated with increased odds of death.CONCLUSION: We identified socio-demographics and clinical characteristics associated with inpatient chemotherapy in DLBCL patients. Chemotherapy is associated with lower odds of death during hospitalization, suggesting that most chemotherapy is given appropriately to non-critically ill patients. Clinical acuity is a stronger predictor of death than socio-demographics.","Cancer epidemiology","53",NA

The biosensing system is based on the nanochannels blockage upon immunocomplex formation, which is electrically monitored through the voltammetric oxidation of Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs). Models evaluated include a neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-AS) and immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) as a control of high PTHLH production. The effect of total number of seeded cells and incubation time on the secreted PTHLH levels is assessed, finding that secreted PTHLH levels range from approximately 60 to 400<U+202F>ng/mL. Moreover, our methodology is also applied to analyse PTHLH production following PTHLH gene knockdown upon transient cell transfection with a specific silencing RNA (siRNA). Given that inhibition of PTHLH secretion reduces cell proliferation, survival and invasiveness in a number of tumors, our system provides a powerful tool for the preclinical evaluation of therapies that regulate PTHLH production. This nanoporous membrane - based sensing technology might be useful to monitor the active secretion of other proteins as well, thus contributing to characterize their regulation and function.","Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics","107",NA

Dysregulation of this FGF19/FGFR4/ßKL signaling axis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer has not been determined.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to assess FGF19, FGFR4 and ßKL concentrations in a group of 36 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 11 patients with follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), 9 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and a group of 19 subjects with multinodular nontoxic goiter (MNG). The control group consisted of 20 healthy volunteers. Serum FGF19, FGFR4 and ßKL concentrations were measured using specific ELISA methods.RESULTS: Significantly lower concentrations of ßKL and higher concentrations of FGF19 were found in patients with PTC, FTC and ATC as compared with MNG group and controls. An elevation of FGFR4 serum concentration was observed in all thyroid cancer groups in comparison to MNG group and controls; however, in FTC group it was statistically insignificant. A positive correlation was found between ßKL and FGFR4 concentrations in PTC patients. The levels of ßKL, FGF19 and FGFR4 did not differ significantly between MNG group and healthy controls.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a disrupted FGF19/FGFR4/ßKL signaling pathway may play a role in the development of thyroid cancers. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the neoplastic transition of thyroid epithelial cells.","Cytokine","105",NA

Adverse side effects and resistance to platinum based chemotherapy have become the major obstacles for ovarian cancer treatment. Natural products have gained great attention in cancer treatment in recent years. Chinese bayberry leaves flavonoids (BLF) containing rich content of myricitrin (myricetin 3-O-rhamnoside) and a part of quercetrin (quercetin 3-rhamnoside) inhibited the growth of an ovarian cancer cell line A2780/CP70. Such inhibitory effects might be due to the induction of apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest. BLF treatment increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and -7 and induced apoptosis via a Erk-dependent caspase-9 activation intrinsic apoptotic pathway by up-regulating the pro-apoptotic proteins (Bad and Bax) and down-regulating the anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL and Bcl-2), which were also in consistency with the results from Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, by reducing the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 and p-Erk, BLF elevated the distribution of G1 phase in cell cycle and thus caused G1 cell cycle arrest. Overall, these results indicated that BLPs could be a valuable resource of natural compound for ovarian cancer treatment.","European journal of medicinal chemistry","147",NA

It is estimated that about 686 thousand people died annually of liver damage resulted from HBV infections. At present, two classes of antiviral drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hepatitis B, immunomodulators (interferon [IFN]-a and pegylated-interferon [PEG-IFN]-a) and nucleos(t)ide analogs (lamivudine, telbivudine, adefovir, tenofovir [TDF], and entecavir [ETV]). However, it still remains a daunting challenge for curing HBV, because of the low sustained response rates (20-30%) and many side effects of IFN and peg-IFN. Although nucleoside analogues are well tolerated and exhibit an early and potent antiviral effect, the selection of resistant mutants and nephrotoxicity during long-term therapy limit their use.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the reverse effect of DHI on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in H9c2 cells. The results of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay demonstrated that DHI had no cytotoxicity towards the relevant cell line unless the concentration was as high as 50<U+202F>µL/mL. The satisfactory cardioprotective effect of DHI exerted at the concentration of 10<U+202F>µL/mL, which agreed well with the result of real-time cell viability assay. Then non-targeted metabolomics based on LC-MS was employed to characterize metabolic alterations in DOX-induced cells with DHI treatment. Multivariate analysis, including PCA and PLS-DA, revealed 31 altered metabolites after DOX treatment that were primarily related to the disturbance of amino acids and nucleotides metabolism. While DHI could intervene in some disturbed metabolic pathways, such as the metabolism of arginine, glutathione (GSH), pantothenic acid, cytidine, inosine and 5'-methylthioadenosine. These results suggested that DHI exerted the therapeutic effect by improving energy metabolism and attenuating oxidative stress. The present study can lay a foundation for further research on the promising therapeutic effect of DHI in managing DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.","Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis","152",NA

Nevertheless, the clinical significance of SIRT7 and its role in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is largely undiscovered. Here, we found that SIRT7 displayed higher expression in CCA tissues compared to intrahepatic normal bile duct and surrounding liver tissues based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Our data further confirmed that SIRT7 was overexpressed in CCA patient tissues and cell lines. Clinical analysis revealed that high SIRT7 expression was correlated with large tumor size and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Furthermore, SIRT7 overexpression independently predicted poor prognosis of CCA patients. Functionally, we demonstrated that SIRT7 knockdown suppressed proliferation and cell cycle progression of HUCCT1 cells in vitro and in vivo. SIRT7 restoration promoted the growth of QBC-939 cells. Mechanistically, SIRT7 reduced p21 expression and increased the levels of Cyclin D1 and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in CCA cells. Furthermore, microRNA-125b-5p (miR-125b-5p) was recognized as a direct negative regulator of SIRT7 and reduced SIRT7 abundance in CCA cells. Notably, miR-125b-5p restoration showed similar effects to SIRT7 knockdown on the growth of CCA cells. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that miR-125b-5p regulation of SIRT7 functions as an oncogene and a potential prognostic biomarker in CCA.","Biomedicine &amp; pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine &amp; pharmacotherapie","100",NA

This alternative approach is in contrast to the widely used conventional clustering approaches that incorporate all molecular peaks for clustering in metabolic studies and require a priori specification of the number of clusters. We perform the comparative analysis of the proposed strategy with other bi-clustering approaches, which were developed in the context of genomics and transcriptomics research. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed bi-clustering strategy on both simulated (NMR) and real (MS) bacterial metabolic data.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",NA,NA

Correlation between intraoperative hippocampal seizures and preoperative MRI, hippocampal histopathology, and EEG from invasive monitoring was determined.RESULTS: IH-ECoG captured electrographic seizures in 15/40 patients (in 8/23 with abnormal hippocampal signal on MRI and 7/17 patients without MRI abnormality). Hippocampal neuronal loss was observed in 22/40 (Group 1), while 18/40 had no significant neuronal loss (Group 2). In Group 1, 4/22 had seizures on IH-ECoG, while 11/18 had electrographic seizures in Group 2. In 24/40 patients who underwent prolonged extraoperative intracranial EEG (IC-EEG) recording, hippocampal seizures were captured in 14. Of these, 7 also had seizures during IH-ECoG. In 10/24 IC-EEG patients without seizures, 3 had seizures on IH-ECoG.CONCLUSIONS: IH-ECoG frequently captures spontaneous electrographic seizures. These are more likely to occur in patients with pathologic processes that do not disrupt/infiltrate hippocampus compared to patients with intractable epilepsy associated with disrupted hippocampal architecture.SIGNIFICANCE: Intraoperative hippocampal seizures may result from deafferentation from the temporal neocortex and disinhibition of the perforant pathway.","Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology","129","4"

More than 90% of oligodendrogliomas have supratentorial localization. Oligodendrogliomas arising in cerebellar peduncle are substantially rare even less than 1%. Up to now, six oligodendroglioma cases with cerebellar peduncle localization have been presented. We aimed to discuss our WHO grade II oligodendroglioma case which originated from cerebellar peduncle in the light of literature.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of 43-year-old woman. Her complaints were headache, perioral numbness and gait abnormality. MRI revealed cyst-like well-demarcated lesion localized in right cerebellar peduncle. Tumor excision was performed by turning around the tumor.CONCLUSION: It should be kept in mind that oligodendrogliomas may be present as cerebellar peduncle localized tumors.","World neurosurgery",NA,NA

Here, we report for the first time the construction and characterization of antibody-fusion proteins featuring granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-3 as payloads capable of enhancing neutrophil activity and a novel antibody-interleukin-4 fusion protein with neutrophil inhibitory potential. We used the F8 antibody specific to the alternatively-spliced extra domain A (EDA) of fibronectin as a targeting agent, since the cognate antigen is strongly upregulated in diseases characterized by angiogenesis. The fusion proteins GCSF-F8, F8-IL3 and F8-IL4-F8, were cloned, expressed, and their targeting ability assessed, exhibiting preferential tumor uptake with tumor:blood ratios at 24 hours after injection of 3.3, 18.2 and 27.3, respectively. In F9 tumor bearing-mice GCSF-F8 and F8-IL3 did not provide a therapeutic benefit, while F8-IL4-F8 showed a potent tumor growth retardation. In the collagen-induced model of arthritis, GCSF-F8 and F8-IL3 induced a worsening of the disease, while F8-IL4-F8 slowed arthritis progression but, surprisingly, exhibited substantial toxicity when used in combination with dexamethasone. Collectively, the results indicate that the novel fusion proteins could be expressed and efficiently delivered to the site of disease. However, they were not superior to other antibody-cytokine fusions previously described by our laboratory.","Journal of biotechnology",NA,NA

MiRNA-320c, an important member of miRNA-320 family, was characterized as a new candidate miRNA that suppressed the development of colorectal cancer and bladder cancer. However, the function of miRNA-320c in human glioma remained unclear. Here, we found that miRNA-320c was significantly down-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines in contrast with normal brain tissues, being tightly related to clinical stage of glioma by qRT-PCR. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with low miRNA-320c expression had a shorter survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miRNA-320c could serve as an independent poor prognostic factor for patients with glioma. Functionally, overexpression of miRNA-320c could dramatically inhibit glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as promote apoptosis. Further analysis indicated that overexpression of miRNA-320c dramatically led to the G0/G1 phase arrest and correspondingly decreased the percentage of S phase cells by suppressing the expression of G1/S transition key regulators, such as Cyclin D1 and CDK6. Additionally, up-regulation of miRNA-320c could significantly impair migration and invasion of glioma cells via reducing the expression of MMP2, MMP9, N-cadherin and Integrin ß1. Collectively, our data revealed that miRNA-320c played a crucial role in the carcinoma processes of glioma and might serve as a new prognosis biomarker and therapeutic target of glioma.","Brain research bulletin",NA,NA

High basal levels of active, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) are associated with tumor progression and therapeutic resistance in some breast cancer subtypes, including HER2 positive breast cancers. Various stimuli can increase pAKT levels and elevated basal pAKT levels are a feature of PTEN-deficient breast cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to develop an assay able to identify modulators of pAKT levels using an automated epifluorescence microscope and high content analysis. To develop this assay, we used HCC-1569, a PTEN-deficient, HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line with elevated basal pAKT levels. HCC-1569 cells were treated with a selective pharmacological inhibitor of AKT (MK-2206) to reduce basal pAKT levels or EGF to increase pAKT levels. Immunofluorescence images were acquired using an automated epifluorescence microscope and integrated intensity of cytoplasmic pAKT staining was calculated using high content analysis software. Mean and median integrated cytoplasmic intensity were normalized using fold change and standard score to assess assay quality and to identify most robust data analysis. The highest z' factor was achieved for median data normalization using the standard score method (z'<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.45). Using our developed assay we identified the calcium homeostasis regulating proteins TPRV6, STIM1 and TRPC1 as modulators of pAKT levels in HCC-1569 cells. Calcium signaling controls a diverse array of cellular processes and some calcium homeostasis regulating proteins are involved in modulating pAKT levels in cancer cells. Thus, these identified hits present promising targets for further assessment.","Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods",NA,NA

For ODM-204, has a dual mechanism of action. The compound is anticipated to efficiently dampen androgenic stimuli in the body by inhibiting CYP17A1, the prerequisite enzyme for the formation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (T), and by blocking AR with high affinity and specificity. In our study, ODM-204 inhibited the proliferation of androgen-dependent VCaP and LNCaP cells in vitro and reduced significantly tumour growth in a murine VCaP xenograft model in vivo. Intriguingly, after a single oral dose of 10-30 mg/kg, ODM-204 dose-dependently inhibited adrenal and testicular steroid production in sexually mature male cynomolgus monkeys. Similar results were obtained in human chorionic gonadotropin-treated male rats. In rats, leuprolide acetate-mediated (LHRH agonist) suppression of the circulating testosterone levels and decrease in weights of androgen-sensitive organs was significantly and dose-dependently potentiated by the co-administration of ODM-204.

This can cause the metabolism of tumor cells as well as the neighboring stromal cells to be remodelled to facilitate tumor survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Abnormal tumor lipid metabolism is a fairly new field, which has received attention in the past few years. Cross-talk between tumor cells and tumor associated stromal cells modulates the high metabolic needs of the tumor. Fatty acid turnover is high in tumor cells to meet the energy as well as synthetic requirements of the growing tumor. Lipolysis of lipids stored in lipid droplets was earlier considered to be solely carried out by cytosolic lipases. However recent studies demonstrate that lipophagy (autophagic degradation of lipids by acidic lipases) serves as an alternate pathway for the degradation of lipid droplets. Involvement of lipophagy in lipid turnover makes it a crucial player in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this review we discuss the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells with special focus on lipid metabolism. We also address the lipid turnover machinery in the tumor cell, especially the lipophagic pathway. Finally, we integrate the current understanding of lipophagy with tumor lipid metabolism.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications",NA,NA

Promoter hypermethylation events in transformation involve primarily pro-survival and developmental genes, similarly modified in primary tumors. Senescence-associated hypermethylation mainly involves metabolic regulators and appears early in proliferating &quot;near-senescent&quot; cells, which can be immortalized but are refractory to transformation. Importantly, a subset of transformation-associated hypermethylated developmental genes exhibits highest methylation gains at all age-associated cancer risk states across tissue types. These epigenetic changes favoring cell self-renewal and survival, arising during tissue aging, are fundamentally important for stratifying cancer risk and concepts for cancer prevention.","Cancer cell","33","2"

Molecular events driving SC-to-MPNST transformation are incompletely understood. Here, we show that human MPNSTs exhibit elevated HIPPO-TAZ/YAP expression, and that TAZ/YAP hyperactivity in SCs caused by Lats1/2 loss potently induces high-grade nerve-associated tumors with full penetrance. Lats1/2 deficiency reprograms SCs to a cancerous, progenitor-like phenotype and promotes hyperproliferation. Conversely, disruption of TAZ/YAP activity alleviates tumor burden in Lats1/2-deficient mice and inhibits human MPNST cell proliferation. Moreover, genome-wide profiling reveals that TAZ/YAP-TEAD1 directly activates oncogenic programs, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling. Co-targeting TAZ/YAP and PDGFR pathways inhibits tumor growth. Thus, our findings establish a previously unrecognized convergence between Lats1/2-TAZ/YAP signaling and MPNST pathogenesis, revealing potential therapeutic targets in these untreatable tumors.","Cancer cell","33","2"

The melanoma is widely excised together with a safety margin of surrounding skin and subcutaneous tissue, after the diagnosis and Breslow thickness have been established by histological assessment of the initial excision biopsy specimen. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be discussed for melanomas = 1 mm thickness (= 0.8 mm if other high risk features) in which case lymphoscintigraphy must be performed before wider excision of the primary melanoma site. The 2008 evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of melanoma (http://www.cancer.org.au/content/pdf/HealthProfessionals/ClinicalGuidelines/ClinicalPracticeGuidelines-ManagementofMelanoma.pdf) are currently being revised and updated in a staged process by a multidisciplinary working party established by Cancer Council Australia. The guidelines for definitive excision margins for primary melanomas have been revised as part of this process. Main recommendations: The recommendations for definitive wide local excision of primary cutaneous melanoma are: melanoma in situ: 5-10 mm margins invasive melanoma (pT1) = 1.0 mm thick: 1 cm margins invasive melanoma (pT2) 1.01-2.00 mm thick: 1-2 cm margins invasive melanoma (pT3) 2.01-4.00 mm thick: 1-2 cm margins invasive melanoma (pT4) &gt; 4.0 mm thick: 2 cm margins Changes in management as a result of the guideline: Based on currently available evidence, excision margins for invasive melanoma have been left unchanged compared with the 2008 guidelines. However, melanoma in situ should be excised with 5-10 mm margins, with the aim of achieving complete histological clearance. Minimum clearances from all margins should be assessed and stated. Consideration should be given to further excision if necessary; positive or close histological margins are unacceptable.","The Medical journal of Australia","208","3"

Menopausal symptoms often occur at an earlier age in women with cancer, and may be more severe than in natural menopause; they may be the most persistent and troubling sequelae of cancer. A third of female patients with cancer report dissatisfaction with the quality and length of physician-patient discussions about reproductive health, including menopause. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, but it is not suitable for all patients after cancer - where it is unsuitable, alternative effective non-hormonal treatments are available. Effective pharmacological agents available to treat vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, clonidine and gabapentin. There is increasing evidence supporting cognitive behavioural therapy for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, in self-help or group settings. Vaginal atrophy can be treated with vaginal (topical) oestrogen with minimal systemic absorption; topical vaginal lubricants may help with vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, with some evidence suggesting that silicone-based products may be more effective than water-based ones. Bone health may be impaired in post-menopausal women with cancer or in cancer survivors, particularly in women with treatment-related menopause or in women receiving anti-oestrogen therapies; this should be managed in addition to menopausal symptoms. Primary care physicians should be aware of the troublesome and ongoing nature of menopausal symptoms after cancer, should discuss them with all patients after cancer treatment, and should consider treatment or referral to a specialist for appropriate management.","The Medical journal of Australia","208","3"

Pathological progression, treatment conversion and triggers for non-protocol biopsy were recorded prospectively.RESULTS: Data from 157 men enrolled on this protocol (median: age 64years, PSA 6.8ng/ml, follow-up 39 months) was interrogated. 12 men (7.6%) left AS through patient choice. Of the 145 men who remained, 104 had re-biopsies either triggered by a PSA rise, MRI change or by protocol. Overall 23 men (15.8%) demonstrated disease progression; 20 from pathological changes and 3 from imaging changes. 17/23 of these switched to treatment giving a conversion rate of 11.7% (&lt;4% per year). Of the 20 men with pathological progression 20% were detected from a PSA increase triggering a re-biopsy compared to 50% due to an mpMRI change. 30% however were detected solely from a protocol re-biopsy without prior PSA or MRI changes. Using PSA and MRI changes alone to detect progression demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 70.0% and 81.7% respectively.CONCLUSION: An AS protocol with thorough baseline assessment and imaging based surveillance shows low rates of progression and treatment conversion. mpMRI changes were the principle trigger in detecting progression by imaging alone or pathologically. Protocol re-biopsy however still detected a significant number of pathological progressions without mpMRI or PSA changes. This article is protected by copyright.

The amphiphilic micelles from DOX-S-S-PEG can be disrupted under glutathione (1mg mL-1) circumstance. Cell viability of A549 cells and 293T cells was evaluated by CCK-8 and Muse Annexin V &amp; Dead Cell Kit. The disrupted polyprodrugs maintained drug activity for killing tumor cells. Meanwhile, the un-disrupted polyprodrugs possessed low cytotoxicity to normal cells. The cell uptake experiments showed that the micelles of DOX-S-S-PEG were taken up by A549 cells and distributed to cell nuclei. Thus, the drug self-delivery systems with drug repeat units in hydrophobic cores linked by disulfide bonds show significant special advantages, which make them as perfect drug self-delivery systems for potential high efficient cancer therapy.","Chemistry, an Asian journal",NA,NA

Elevated levels of ROS lead to increased amounts of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. We report that levels of M1dG, a major endogenous peroxidation-derived DNA adduct, are 50-100-fold higher in mtDNA than in nuclear DNA in several different human cell lines. Treatment of cells with agents that either increase or decrease mitochondrial superoxide levels leads to increased or decreased levels of M1dG in mtDNA, respectively. Sequence analysis of adducted mtDNA suggests that M1dG residues are randomly distributed throughout the mitochondrial genome. Basal levels of M1dG in mtDNA from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) from transgenic bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 mutant mice (BMPR2R899X) (four adducts per 106 dG) are twice as high as adduct levels in wild-type cells. A similar increase was observed in mtDNA from heterozygous null (BMPR2+/-) compared to wild-type PMVECs. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is observed in the presence of BMPR2 signaling disruptions, which are also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidant injury to endothelial tissue. Persistence of M1dG adducts in mtDNA could have implications for mutagenesis and mitochondrial gene expression, thereby contributing to the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in diseases.","Nucleic acids research",NA,NA

"113","29438494","Artificial intelligence in drug combination therapy.","Currently, the development of medicines for complex diseases requires the development of combination drug therapies. It is necessary because in many cases, one drug cannot target all necessary points of intervention. For example, in cancer therapy, a physician often meets a patient having a genomic profile including more than five molecular aberrations. Drug combination therapy has been an area of interest for a while, for example the classical work of Loewe devoted to the synergism of drugs was published in 1928-and it is still used in calculations for optimal drug combinations. More recently, over the past several years, there has been an explosion in the available information related to the properties of drugs and the biomedical parameters of patients. For the drugs, hundreds of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors for medicines are now available, while for patients, large data sets related to genetic/proteomic and metabolomics profiles of the patients are now available, as well as the more traditional data relating to the histology, history of treatments, pretreatment state of the organism, etc. Moreover, during disease progression, the genetic profile can change. Thus, the ability to optimize drug combinations for each patient is rapidly moving beyond the comprehension and capabilities of an individual physician. This is the reason, that biomedical informatics methods have been developed and one of the more promising directions in this field is the application of artificial intelligence (AI). In this review, we discuss several AI methods that have been successfully implemented in several instances of combination drug therapy from HIV, hypertension, infectious diseases to cancer. The data clearly show that the combination of rule-based expert systems with machine learning algorithms may be promising direction in this field.","Briefings in bioinformatics",NA,NA

In fact, as few as 25% of KS patients are accurately diagnosed, and most of these diagnoses are not made until adulthood. Classic characteristics of KS include small testes, infertility, hypergonadothropic hypogonadism, and cognitive impairment. However, the pathophysiology behind KS is not well understood, although genetic effects are also thought to play a role. For example, recent developments in genetics and genomics point to a fundamental change in our understanding of KS, with global epigenetic and RNA expression changes playing a central role for the phenotype.KS is also associated with more general health markers, including higher morbidity and mortality rates, and lower socio-economic status (which likely affects both morbidity and mortality). In addition, hypogonadism is associated with greater risk of of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and extragonadal germ cell tumors. Medical treatment typically focuses on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), although the effects of this therapy has not been studied rigorously, and future studies need to evaluate the effects of TRT on metabolic risk and neurocognitive outcomes.This review presents a comprehensive, interdisciplinary examination of recent developments in genetic, endocrine and neurocognitive science, including the study of animal models regarding KS. It also provides a number of recommendations for improving the effectiveness of research and clinical practice, including neonatal KS screening programs, and a multidisciplinary approach to KS treatment from childhood until senescence.","Endocrine reviews",NA,NA

"121","29438442","The siRNA-mediated knockdown of GluN3A in 46C-derived neural stem cells affects mRNA expression levels of neural genes, including known iGluR interactors.","For years, GluN3A was solely considered to be a dominant-negative modulator of NMDARs, since its incorporation into receptors alters hallmark features of conventional NMDARs composed of GluN1/GluN2 subunits. Only recently, increasing evidence has accumulated that GluN3A plays a more diversified role. It is considered to be critically involved in the maturation of glutamatergic synapses, and it might act as a molecular brake to prevent premature synaptic strengthening. Its expression pattern supports a putative role during neural development, since GluN3A is predominantly expressed in early pre- and postnatal stages. In this study, we used RNA interference to efficiently knock down GluN3A in 46C-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) both at the mRNA and at the protein level. Global gene expression profiling upon GluN3A knockdown revealed significantly altered expression of a multitude of neural genes, including genes encoding small GTPases, retinal proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins, some of which have been previously shown to interact with GluN3A or other iGluR subunits. Canonical pathway enrichment studies point at important roles of GluN3A affecting key cellular pathways involved in cell growth, proliferation, motility, and survival, such as the mTOR pathway. This study for the first time provides insights into transcriptome changes upon the specific knockdown of an NMDAR subunit in NSCs, which may help to identify additional functions and downstream pathways of GluN3A and GluN3A-containing NMDARs.","PloS one","13","2"

To resolve this issue, we employed breast and colorectal cancer in vitro, and investigated whether trained dogs to odor related to metabolic waste from breast cancer are able to detect it from colorectal cancer, and vice versa. The culture liquid samples used in the cultivation of cancerous cells (4T1 and CT26) were employed as an experimental group. Two different breeds of dogs were trained for the different cancer odor each other. The dogs were then tested using a double-blind method and cross-test to determine whether they could correctly detect the experimental group, which contains the specific odor for metabolic waste of familiar or unfamiliar cancer. For two cancers, both dogs regardless of whether training or non-training showed that accuracy was over 90%, and sensitivity and specificity were over 0.9, respectively. Through these results, it was verified that the superior olfactory ability of dogs can discriminate odor for metabolic waste of cancer cells from it of benign cells, and that the specific odor for metabolic waste of breast cancer has not significant differences to it of colorectal cancer. That is, it testifies that metabolic waste between breast and colorectal cancer have the common specific odor in vitro. Accordingly, a trained dogs for detecting odor for metabolic waste of breast cancer can perceive it of colorectal cancer, and vice versa. In order to the future work, we will plan in vivo experiment for the two cancers and suggest research as to what kind of cancers have the common specific odor. Furthermore, the relationship between breast and colorectal cancer should be investigated using other research methods.","PloS one","13","2"
"123","29438412","Tissue distribution and subcellular localizations determine in vivo functional relationship among prostasin, matriptase, HAI-1, and HAI-2 in human skin.","The membrane-bound serine proteases prostasin and matriptase and the Kunitz-type protease inhibitors HAI-1 and HAI-2 are all expressed in human skin and may form a tightly regulated proteolysis network, contributing to skin pathophysiology. Evidence from other systems, however, suggests that the relationship between matriptase and prostasin and between the proteases and the inhibitors can be context-dependent. In this study the in vivo zymogen activation and protease inhibition status of matriptase and prostasin were investigated in the human skin. Immunohistochemistry detected high levels of activated prostasin in the granular layer, but only low levels of activated matriptase restricted to the basal layer. Immunoblot analysis of foreskin lysates confirmed this in vivo zymogen activation status and further revealed that HAI-1 but not HAI-2 is the prominent inhibitor for prostasin and matriptase in skin. The zymogen activation status and location of the proteases does not support a close functional relation between matriptase and prostasin in the human skin. The limited role for HAI-2 in the inhibition of matriptase and prostasin is the result of its primarily intracellular localization in basal and spinous layer keratinocytes, which probably prevents the Kunitz inhibitor from interacting with active prostasin or matriptase. In contrast, the cell surface expression of HAI-1 in all viable epidermal layers renders it an effective regulator for matriptase and prostasin. Collectively, our study suggests the importance of tissue distribution and subcellular localization in the functional relationship between proteases and protease inhibitors.","PloS one","13","2"

The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data from Latin populations of Hispanic origin. In this pilot study, metabolomic and lipidomic approaches were performed to establish a plasma metabolic fingerprint of Colombian Hispanic women with BC. Data from 1H-NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS were combined and compared. Statistics showed discrimination between breast cancer and healthy subjects on all analytical platforms. The differentiating metabolites were involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches in metabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts in metabolism. Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that could contribute to a better understanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC in women of Colombian Hispanic origin. Particularly, the understanding of the up-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines and the down-regulation of cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). In addition, the mapped metabolic signatures in breast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-Hispanic women, despite racial differences.","PloS one","13","2"

Serial PET/MRI were performed before, 4 hours after and 1-week after vascular disrupting agent, CKD-516 at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg (treated group, n = 10) or saline (control group, n = 8) administration. PET/MRI-derived parameters and their interval changes were compared between the treated and control group by using the linear mixed model. Each parameter within each group was also compared by using the linear mixed model.RESULTS: Changes of the volume transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and the initial area under the gadolinium concentration-time curve until 60 seconds (iAUC) in the treated group were significantly larger compared with those in the control group at 4-hour follow-up (mean, -39.91% vs. -6.04%, P = 0.018; and -49.71% vs. +6.23%, P = 0.013). Change of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in the treated group was significantly smaller compared with that in the control group at 1-week follow-up (mean, +118.34% vs. +208.87%, P = 0.044). Serial measurements in the treated group revealed that Ktrans and iAUC decreased at 4-hour follow-up (P &lt; 0.001) and partially recovered at 1-week follow-up (P = 0.001 and 0.024, respectively). MTV increased at a 4-hour follow-up (P = 0.038) and further increased at a 1-week follow-up (P &lt; 0.001), while total lesion glycolysis (TLG) did not show a significant difference between the time points. SUVmax and SUVmean did not show significant interval changes between time points (P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: PET/MRI is able to monitor the changes of vascular and metabolic parameters at different time points simultaneously, and confirmed that vascular changes precede the metabolic changes by VDA, CKD-516.","PloS one","13","2"

Intermediate molecular biomarkers could aid risk prediction by capturing both known and unknown risk factors.METHODS: We sampled normal bowel mucosa from the proximal colon, distal colon and rectum of 317 individuals undergoing colonoscopy. We defined cases as having a personal history of colorectal polyp(s)/cancer, and controls as having no history of colorectal neoplasia. Molecular analyses were performed for: telomere length (TL); global methylation; and the expression of genes in molecular pathways associated with colorectal tumourigenesis. We also calculated a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on CRC susceptibility polymorphisms.RESULTS: Bowel TL was significantly longer in cases than controls, but was not associated with blood TL. PRS was significantly and independently higher in cases. Hypermethylation showed a suggestive association with case:control status. No gene or pathway was differentially expressed between cases and controls. Gene expression often varied considerably between bowel locations.CONCLUSIONS: PRS and bowel TL (but not blood TL) may be clinically-useful predictors of CRC risk. Sample collection to assess these biomarkers is feasible in clinical practice, especially where population screening uses flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 13 February 2018; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.486 www.bjcancer.com.","British journal of cancer",NA,NA

In the 60 RTs on 27 FDA-approved mAbs with available FIHT, the FIHT RP2D was tested only for two mAbs, and RT doses were much lower than the FIHT MAD.CONCLUSIONS: The rationale beyond dose selection in phase II and III trials of mAbs is often unclear in published articles and not based on FIHT data.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 13 February 2018; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.473 www.bjcancer.com.","British journal of cancer",NA,NA

It has been reported that exosomes derived from cancer cells play an important role in the intracellular communications involved in the development of carcinoma. However, the role of exosomes from fibroblasts remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the effect of exosomes from fibroblasts on the motility of gastric cancer cells.METHODS: 5 gastric cancer cell lines were used: OCUM-12, NUGC-3, MKN45, FU97 and MKN74. 2 cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were used. CD9 expression of exosomes from fibroblasts was examined by western blot. The effect of exosomes on the motility of cancer cells was analysed by migration assays. MMP2 was examined by RT-PCR or gelatin zymography. Then, CD9 and MMP2 expressions of 619 gastric cancers were analysed by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Exosomes from CAFs were taken into scirrhous-type gastric cancer cells, namely OCUM-12 cells and NUGC-3 cells, but not into other types of gastric cancer cells. Exosomes from CAFs were positive for CD9. Exosomes from CAFs significantly stimulated the migration and invasion of OCUM-12 and NUGC-3 cells, which was inhibited by anti-CD9 antibody or CD9-siRNA. MMP2 expression of OCUM-12 and NUGC-3 cells was significantly decreased by CD9-siRNA. 116 CD9-positive cases were significantly correlated with scirrhous-type gastric cancer, lymph node metastasis and venous invasion. The 5-year survival rate of patients with CD9-positive tumours was significantly lower (P&lt;0.001) than in those with CD9-negative tumours.CONCLUSIONS: CD9-positive exosomes from CAFs might stimulate the migration ability of scirrhous-type gastric cancer cells.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication: 13 February 2018 doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.487 www.bjcancer.com.","British journal of cancer",NA,NA

"143","29438358","Strategies to Improve the Clinical Utility of Saporin-Based Targeted Toxins.","Plant Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) including the type I RIP Saporin have been used for the construction of Immunotoxins (ITxs) obtained via chemical conjugation of the toxic domain to whole antibodies or by generating genetic fusions to antibody fragments/targeting domains able to direct the chimeric toxin against a desired sub-population of cancer cells. The high enzymatic activity, stability and resistance to conjugation procedures and especially the possibility to express recombinant fusions in yeast, make Saporin a well-suited tool for anti-cancer therapy approaches. Previous clinical work on RIPs-based Immunotoxins (including Saporin) has shown that several critical issues must be taken into deeper consideration to fully exploit their therapeutic potential. This review focuses on possible combinatorial strategies (chemical and genetic) to augment Saporin-targeted toxin efficacy. Combinatorial approaches may facilitate RIP escape into the cytosolic compartment (where target ribosomes are), while genetic manipulations may minimize potential adverse effects such as vascular-leak syndrome or may identify T/B cell epitopes in order to decrease the immunogenicity following similar strategies as those used in the case of bacterial toxins such as Pseudomonas Exotoxin A or as for Type I RIP Bouganin. This review will further focus on strategies to improve recombinant production of Saporin-based chimeric toxins.","Toxins","10","2"

Several DNA tumor viruses modulate host DNA methyltransferases for epigenetic dysregulation of immune-related gene expression in host cells. The host immune responses suppressed by virus-induced aberrant DNA methylation are also frequently involved in antitumor immune responses. Here, we describe viral mechanisms and virus-host interactions by which DNA tumor viruses regulate host DNA methylation to evade antiviral immunity, which may contribute to the generation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment during cancer development. Recent trials of immunotherapies have shown promising results to treat multiple cancers; however, a significant number of non-responders necessitate identifying additional targets for cancer immunotherapies. Thus, understanding immune evasion mechanisms of cancer-causing viruses may provide great insights for reversing immune suppression to prevent and treat associated cancers.","Viruses","10","2"

While HPV16 is the most important carcinogenic type, variants of HPV16 can differ in their carcinogenicity by 10-fold or more in epidemiologic studies. Strong genotype-phenotype associations embedded in the small 8-kb HPV16 genome motivate molecular studies to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms of HPV genomic findings is complicated by the linkage of HPV genome variants. A panel of experts in various disciplines gathered on 21 November 2016 to discuss the interdisciplinary science of HPV oncogenesis. Here, we summarize the discussion of the complexity of the viral-host interaction and highlight important next steps for selected applied basic laboratory studies guided by epidemiological genomic findings.","Viruses","10","2"

However, only little is known about the factors that affect the cellular expression levels. Here we assessed the PD-L1 expression on different breast cancer cell lines under standard in vitro culture conditions and as a function of Epirubicin or Paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, we evaluated the expression in immunodeficient tumor mice as well as in humanized tumor mice (i.e., in the presence of a human immune system). We found highest PD-L1 levels in JIMT-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Epirubicin treatment caused a decrease and Paclitaxel treatment an increased PD-L1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, we identified nuclear PD-L1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. All in vivo transplanted breast cancer cell lines downregulated PD-L1 expression compared to their in vitro counterpart. Neither the gene copy number nor the presence of human immune system in humanized tumor mice had an effect on the PD-L1 content. We demonstrate that the degree of PD-L1 expression amongst breast cancer cell lines varies considerably. In addition, cytotoxic treatments and other extrinsic parameters differentially affect the expression. Hence, further investigations including in vivo evaluations are necessary to understand PD-L1 regulation for advanced breast cancer stratification.","International journal of molecular sciences","19","2"

Intercellular communication within this niche is driven by soluble proteins synthesized by local tumor and stromal cells and include chemokines, growth factors, interferons, interleukins, and angiogenic factors. The interaction of tumor cells with their microenvironment is essential for tumorigenesis, tumor progression, growth, and metastasis, and resistance to drug therapy. Protein arrays enable the parallel detection of hundreds of proteins in a small amount of biological sample. Recent data have demonstrated that the application of protein arrays may yield valuable information regarding the structure and functional mechanisms of the TME. In this review, we will discuss protein array technologies and their applications in TME analysis to discern pathways involved in promoting the tumorigenic phenotype.","International journal of molecular sciences","19","2"

The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein is an important structural protein in NDV pathogenesis and has been postulated as a promising candidate for antitumor therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the anticancer potential of recombinant adenovirus Ad-HN-PEG3p-E1a. An MTS assay was performed to determine viral proliferation after viral infection, the data showed that the proliferation ability of osteosarcoma cells decreased, whereas there was no significant change in normal hepatic cells. DAPI and Annexin V experiments showed that osteosarcoma cells were killed because of apoptosis, active oxygen content, and augmented mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Caspase Activity Assay Kits were used to detect the caspase-3 activities of the treated OS-732 for increased expression. Western blot analysis showed that cytochrome C increased significantly and apoptosis of the virus was confirmed in tumor cells. In-vivo experiments show that NDV has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth. The recombinant adenovirus, which is composed of a HN protein and progressive increment promoter PEG3p, could inhibit the growth of OS-732 and promote the apoptosis of tumor cells. However, there was no clear relationship with normal cell (L02) apoptosis.","Anti-cancer drugs","29","3"

This study aimed to investigate whether a u-Tg below 0.2<U+2009>ng/ml coincides with a s-Tg below 1<U+2009>ng/ml.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 290 patients with nonmetastatic differentiated thyroid cancer were retrospectively evaluated with a median follow-up of 36 months. The levels of s-Tg were observed in patients whose u-Tg levels were below 0.2<U+2009>ng/ml after radioiodine therapy, and risk factors associated with the increase of s-Tg to above 1<U+2009>ng/ml from below 0.2<U+2009>ng/ml were analyzed.RESULTS: In total, 52.8% (153/290) of the patients achieved a u-Tg below 0.2<U+2009>ng/ml 3 months after remnant ablation, most of whom (83.7%, 128/153) also achieved a s-Tg below 1<U+2009>ng/ml. A total of 25 (16.3%) patients had an increased s-Tg above 1<U+2009>ng/ml. A comparative analysis showed no significant difference between patients who showed an increase in thyroglobulin from below 0.2<U+2009>ng/ml to above 1<U+2009>ng/ml and those who did not. In a subgroup analysis assessing the influence of thyrotropin (thyroxin-stimulating hormone) on s-Tg, we enrolled 43 patients with at least two s-Tg measurements. We found that a higher level of thyroxin-stimulating hormone (118.23±30.72 vs. 59.99±26.12<U+2009>µIU/ml) increased the s-Tg in 88.4% patients (P=0.00), which led to more patients (18.6-30.2%) with an increased s-Tg (to above 1<U+2009>ng/ml) after thyroxin withdrawal.CONCLUSION: Assessment of the level of u-Tg might be a better parameter to use for defining excellent response as u-Tg is more stable, convenient, economical, and is not associated with hypothyroidism as a side effect.","Nuclear medicine communications","39","3"

Attention is required for the craniofacial growth over time, involvement of the permanent dentition, facial symmetry, and donor site morbidity. Our aim is to identify the best reconstructive options for maxilla-mandibular defects in children (&lt;18 years) based on our experience with 25 pediatric patients. We believe that reconstruction has to be performed at the same time as resection in pediatric patients. Local flaps should be reserved for cases of maxillary defects because of malignant neoplasms, which ultimately have poor prognosis. In cases of large mandibular defects, radiotherapy is eventually required. When the condition of the soft tissues is poor (because of previous surgery, etc), free flaps potentially represent the best options. Nevertheless, in patients younger than 5 years old (with no damaged tissues), reconstruction with rib grafts should be performed, and the use of titanium plates should be reserved for very select cases (such as temporary reconstruction in toddlers).","The Journal of craniofacial surgery",NA,NA

We examine coverage changes associated with ACA implementation, comparing adults with and without a cancer history.METHODS: We included nonelderly adults from the 2012 to 2015 National Health Interview Survey. Using information on state Medicaid policies (2013), expansion decisions (2015), family structure, income, insurance offers, and current coverage, we assigned adults in all 4 years to mutually exclusive eligibility categories including: Medicaid-eligible pre-ACA; expansion eligible for Medicaid; and Marketplace premium subsidy eligible. Linear probability regressions estimated pre-post (2012-2013 vs. 2014-2015) coverage changes by eligibility category, stratified by cancer history.RESULTS: The uninsured rate for cancer survivors decreased from 12.4% to 7.7% (P&lt;0.001) pre-post ACA implementation. Relative to income &gt;400% of the federal poverty guideline, the uninsured rate for cancer survivors decreased by an adjusted 8.4 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-15.6] among pre-ACA Medicaid eligible; 16.7 percentage points (95% CI, 9.0-24.5) among expansion eligible, and 11.3 percentage points (95% CI, -0.8 to 23.5, with a trend P=0.069) for premium subsidy eligible. Decreases in uninsured among expansion-eligible adults without a cancer history [9.7 percentage points (95% CI, 7.4-12.0), were smaller than for cancer survivors (with a trend, P=0.086)]. Despite coverage gains, ~528,000 cancer survivors and 19.1 million without a cancer history remained uninsured post-ACA, yet over half were eligible for Medicaid or subsidized Marketplace coverage.CONCLUSIONS: ACA implementation was associated with large coverage gains in targeted expansion groups, including cancer survivors, but additional progress is needed.","Medical care","56","3"
