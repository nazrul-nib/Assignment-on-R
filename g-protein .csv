"1","29438462","Butyrate: A Double-Edged Sword for Health?","Butyrate, a four-carbon short-chain fatty acid, is produced through microbial fermentation of dietary fibers in the lower intestinal tract. Endogenous butyrate production, delivery, and absorption by colonocytes have been well documented. Butyrate exerts its functions by acting as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor or signaling through several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recently, butyrate has received particular attention for its beneficial effects on intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. With anti-inflammatory properties, butyrate enhances intestinal barrier function and mucosal immunity. However, the role of butyrate in obesity remains controversial. Growing evidence has highlighted the impact of butyrate on the gut-brain axis. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge on the properties of butyrate, especially its potential effects and mechanisms involved in intestinal health and obesity.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)","9","1"

The G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) is known to be an estrogen-responsive receptor, but its role in the degradation of mitochondria in osteoblasts by autophagy, or mitophagy, remains unclear. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of 17ß-estradiol, GPR30, and its signaling pathway, on mitophagy in the murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell line. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell line, cells were treated with 17ß-estradiol, or G15, a selective GPR30 antagonist, or U0126, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK1/2) inhibitor, or with vehicle as control. The expression of GPR30 was determined by Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and confocal immunofluorescence imaging. Cell morphology and mitochondrial autophagosomes were identified using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Phosphorylation of the mitophagy markers, heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), translocase of outer membrane (Tom)20, and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) were determined by Western blot, and cell proliferation was determined using the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. RESULTS The optimum concentration of 17ß-estradiol that resulted in GPR30 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells was 10^-7 M, which led to the accumulation of mitochondrial autophagosomes and increased protein phosphorylation levels of Hsp60, Tom20, and LC3. In cells pretreated with G15 or U0126, 17b-estradiol treatment did not increase mitophagy in MC3T3-E1 cells. CONCLUSIONS In murine osteoblasts cultured in vitro, treatment with 17ß-estradiol resulted in the expression of GPR30 and enhanced mitophagy through the GPR30 and ERK1/2 signaling pathway.","Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","24",NA

We assessed sGPVI levels together with patient and clinical parameters in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, including patients with thermal injury and inflammatory bowel disease and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for elective cardiac surgery, trauma, acute brain injury, or prolonged ventilation. Plasma sGPVI was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was elevated on day 14 after thermal injury, and was higher in patients who developed sepsis. sGPVI levels were associated with sepsis, and the value for predicting sepsis was increased in combination with platelet count and Abbreviated Burn Severity Index. sGPVI levels positively correlated with levels of D-dimer (a fibrin degradation product) in ICU patients and patients with thermal injury. sGPVI levels in ICU patients at admission were significantly associated with 28- and 90-day mortality independent of platelet count. sGPVI levels in patients with thermal injury were associated with 28-day mortality at days 1, 14, and 21 when adjusting for platelet count. In both cohorts, sGPVI associations with mortality were stronger than D-dimer levels. Mechanistically, release of GPVI was triggered by exposure of platelets to polymerized fibrin, but not by engagement of G protein-coupled receptors by thrombin, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, or thromboxane mimetics. Enhanced fibrin production in these patients may therefore contribute to the observed elevated sGPVI levels. sGPVI is an important platelet-specific marker for platelet activation that predicts sepsis progression and mortality in injured patients.","Blood advances","2","3"

"8","29436774","Oxytocin Structure and Function in New World Monkeys: From Pharmacology to Behavior.","Oxytocin (OT) is a hypothalamic nonapeptide that mediates a host of physiological and behavioral processes including reproductive physiology and social attachments. While the OT sequence structure is highly conserved among mammals, New World monkeys (NWMs) represent an unusual 'hot spot' in OT structure variability among mammals. At least six distinct OT ligand variants among NWMs exist, yet it is currently unclear whether these evolved structural changes result in meaningful functional consequences. NWMs offer a new area to explore how these modifications to OT and its canonical G-protein coupled OT receptor (OTR) may mediate specific cellular, physiological, and behavioral outcomes. In this review, we highlight relationships between OT ligand and OTR structural variability specifically examining coevolution between OT ligands, OTRs, and physiological and behavioral phenotypes across NWMs. We consider whether these evolved modifications to the OT structure alter pharmacological profiles at human and marmoset OTRs including changes to receptor binding, intracellular signaling, and receptor internalization. Finally, we evaluate whether exogenous manipulation using OT variants in marmoset monkeys differentially enhance or impair behavioral processes involved in social relationships between pairmates, opposite-sex strangers, and parents and their offspring. Overall, it appears that changes to OT ligands in NWMs result in important changes ranging from cellular signaling to broad measures of social behavior. This article is protected by copyright.

The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has been identified as a non-genomic estrogenic receptor, and is involved in numerous physiological processes, including cell survival, energy provision and metabolism. 17ß-E2 may decrease apoptosis by binding to the GPER. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is involved in physiological and pathological functions such as autophagy. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the mediation of the effects of GPERs, and the effects of 17ß-E2 on mitophagy in INS-1 cells, a rat insulin-secreting ß-cell line. In vitro, INS-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of 17ß-E2 with and without pretreatment with a GPER antagonist (G15) or PI3K antagonist (LY294002) and compared with a negative control. An immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that GPERs are expressed in INS-1 cells. Western blot assays demonstrated that 17ß-E2 increased GPER levels and the phosphorylation of Akt. Transmission electronic microscopy revealed that 17ß-E2 reduced the formation of mitophagosomes and autophagosomes in INS-1 cells. An immunofluorescence staining assay indicated that the co-localization of translocase of mitochondrial outer membrane complex 20 (TOM20) with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) was decreased in INS-1 cells treated with 17ß-E2 alone. Western blotting demonstrated that 17ß-E2 reduced the protein levels of activated microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3, and increased those of TOM20 and mitochondrial heat-shock protein 60. Notably, the protective effects of 17ß-E2 were significantly diminished by G15 or LY294002. In conclusion, the present study suggests that 17ß-E2 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway via the GPER in INS-1 cells. Furthermore, 17ß-E2 may be involved in mitophagy by the regulating the GPER/PI3K/Akt pathway.","International journal of molecular medicine",NA,NA

Heteromers of delta and kappa opioid receptors (DOR-KOR heteromers) have been identified in native systems. We previously reported that activation of DOR-KOR heteromers expressed by rat pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) produces robust, peripherally-mediated antinociception. Moreover, DOR agonist potency and efficacy is regulated by KOR antagonists via allosteric interactions within the DOR-KOR heteromer in a ligand-dependent manner. Here we assessed the reciprocal regulation of KOR agonist function by DOR antagonists in adult rat nociceptors in culture and in a behavioral assay of nociception. Naltrindole enhanced the potency of the KOR agonist ICI-199441 (10-20 fold), but did not alter responses to U50488. By contrast, the potency of U50488 was enhanced (20 fold) by 7-benzylidenenaltrexone. The efficacy of 6'-guanidinonaltrindole (6'-GNTI) to inhibit nociceptors was blocked by siRNA knock-down of DOR or KOR. Replacing 6'-GNTI occupancy of DOR with either naltrindole or 7-benzylidenenaltrexone abolished 6'-GNTI efficacy. Further, peptides derived from DOR transmembrane segment 1, fused to the cell membrane penetrating HIV transactivator of transcription peptide, also blocked 6'-GNTI-mediated responses ex vivo and in vivo, suggesting that 6'-GNTI efficacy in nociceptors is due to its positive allosteric regulation of KOR via occupancy of DOR in a DOR-KOR heteromer. Together, these results provide evidence for the existence of functional DOR-KOR heteromers in rat peripheral sensory neurons and that reciprocal, ligand-dependent, allosteric interactions occur between the DOR and KOR protomers.","Molecular pharmacology",NA,NA

"13","29435986","Role of recoverin in rod photoreceptor light adaptation.","Recoverin is a small molecular-weight, calcium-binding protein in rod outer segments which binds to G-protein receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) and can alter the rate of rhodopsin phosphorylation. A change in phosphorylation should change the lifetime of light-activated rhodopsin and the gain of phototransduction, but deletion of recoverin has little effect on the sensitivity of rods either in the dark or in dim-to-moderate background light. We describe two additional functions perhaps of greater physiological significance. (1) When the ambient intensity increases, sensitivity and integration time decrease in wild-type (WT) rods with similar time constants of 150 - 200 ms. Recoverin is part of the mechanism controlling this process since, in Rv-/- rods lacking recoverin, sensitivity declines more rapidly and integration time is already shorter and not further altered. (2) During steady light exposure, WT rod circulating current slowly increases during a time course of tens of seconds, gradually extending the operating range of the rod. In Rv-/- rods this mechanism is also deleted, steady-state currents are already larger, and rods saturate at brighter intensities. We argue that neither (1) nor (2) can be caused by modulation of rhodopsin phosphorylation but may instead be produced by direct modulation of phophodiesterase-6, the phototransduction effector enzyme. We propose that recoverin in dark-adapted rods keeps the integration time long and the spontaneous PDE6 rate relatively high to improve sensitivity. In background light, the integration time is decreased to facilitate detection of change and motion, and the spontaneous PDE6 rate decreases to augment the rod working range.

The aim of the present study was to identify molecules that regulate PVI. Sections of cancerous tissue, paired noncancerous tissue and the PVI area were collected from 3 frozen HCC sections, using laser microdissection. The present study focused on 3 upregulated molecules, integrin ß3 (ITGB3), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5), and 2 molecules that were downregulated in PVI tissue compared with cancer tissue, metallothionein 1G (MT1G) and metallothionein 1H (MT1H), as determined by cDNA microarray analysis. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of 32 HCC cases revealed that RGS5 mRNA levels were significantly increased and MT1 G and MT1H mRNA levels were significantly decreased in cancerous tissue compared with noncancerous tissue. However, there was no significant difference in ITGB3 and SPP1 expression. There were no significant differences between the expression of these molecules and any clinicopathologic factors, including PVI. Immunohistochemical staining for RGS5 in 60 HCC cases demonstrated that RGS5 protein levels were higher in cancerous tissue compared with paired noncancerous tissue in 63.3% of HCC cases. Furthermore, high expression of RGS5 in cancerous tissue was significantly associated with PVI and tended to be associated with intrahepatic metastasis. Confluent multinodular type was significantly more frequent in cases with high expression of RGS5 in the cancerous tissue. Therefore, RGS5 may be a useful prognostic biomarker as well as a potential target of molecular therapy to treat HCC.","Oncology letters","15","2"

The heptahelical receptors are highly dynamic structures and the signaling efficiency largely depends on the discrete contact with the ligand. In addition, several allosteric modulators of receptor activity have been reported, which do not induce migration by themselves. Another important mechanism modulating the activity of GPCRs is their local environment. Not only the membrane lipid composition influences the activity, but also direct binding of lipids, in particular cholesterol, was shown to alter receptor signaling properties. Recent findings indicate that also chemokine receptor activity is modulated by membrane lipids. In this short review we discuss this new paradigm and potential consequences for chemokine-induced migration.","Cytokine",NA,NA

GPCRs can be activated by a diverse array of ligands including neurotransmitters, chemokines as well as sensory stimuli. Therefore, GPCRs are involved in many key cellular and physiological processes, such as sense of light, taste and smell, neurotransmission, metabolism, endocrine and exocrine secretion. In recent years, GPCRs have been found to play an important role in immune system. T cell is an important type of immune cell, which plays a central role in cell-mediated immunity.

In insects, two stress-related factors include the gonadotropin-releasing hormone-related peptides adipokinetic hormone (AKH) and corazonin (CRZ). AKH is a pleiotropic hormone best known as a substrate liberator of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. CRZ has been shown to have roles in pigmentation, ecdysis or act as a cardiostimulatory factor although a universal function has not yet been elucidated. While both these neuropeptides and their respective receptors (AKHR and CRZR) have been characterized in several organisms, details on their specific roles within the disease vector, Aedes aegypti, remain largely unexplored. Here, we obtained three A. aegypti AKHR transcript variants and further identified the A. aegypti CRZR receptor. Receptor expression using a heterologous functional assay revealed that these receptors exhibit a highly specific response for their native ligands. Developmental quantitative expression analysis of CRZR revealed enrichment during the pupal and adult stages. In adults, quantitative spatial expression analysis revealed CRZR transcript in a variety of organs including head, thoracic ganglia, primary reproductive organs (ovary and testis), as well as male carcass. This suggest CRZ may play a role in ecdysis, and neuronal expression of CRZR indicates a possible role for CRZ within the nervous system. Quantitative developmental expression analysis of AKHR identified significant transcript enrichment in early adult stages. AKHR transcript was observed in the head, thoracic ganglia, accessory reproductive tissues and the carcass of adult females, while it was detected in the abdominal ganglia and enriched significantly in the carcass of adult males, which supports the known function of AKH in energy metabolism. Collectively, given the enrichment of CRZR and AKHR in the primary and secondary sex organs, respectively, of adult mosquitoes, these neuropeptides may play a role in regulating mosquito reproductive biology.","Biochemical and biophysical research communications",NA,NA

Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is the world's most important natural textile fiber and oil crop. VW of cotton is a highly devastating vascular disease, however, few resistant germplasms have been reported in cotton. An increasing number of studies have shown that RNA interference (RNAi) based host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) is an effective strategy for improving plant resistance to pathogens by silencing genes essential for the pathogenicity of these pathogens. Here, we have identified and characterized multifunctional regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) in the Verticillium dahliae virulence strain, Vd8. Of eight VdRGS genes, VdRGS1 showed the most significant increase in expression in V. dahliae after treating with the roots of cotton seedlings. Based on the phenotype detection of VdRGS1 deletion and complementation mutants, we found that VdRGS1 played crucial roles in spore production, hyphal development, microsclerotia formation, and pathogenicity. Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated HIGS in cotton plants silenced VdRGS1 transcripts in invaded V. dahliae strains, and enhanced broad spectrum resistance to cotton Verticillium wilt. Our data demonstrate that VdRGS1 is a conserved and essential gene for V. dahliae virulence. HIGS of VdRGS1 provide effective control against V. dahliae infection and could obtain the durable disease resistance in cotton, and in other Verticillium wilt-susceptible host crops by developing the stable transformants.

One of the features of NPs is excessive fibrin deposition, which is associated with down regulation of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in NPs. As t-PA is expressed in epithelial cells, and epithelium is readily accessible to topical therapies, identifying compounds that can mediate the induction of t-PA would be a potential new strategy for the treatment of NPs.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether SCFAs can induce t-PA in airway epithelial cells via their known receptors GPR41 and GPR43.METHODS: We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine whether receptors for SCFAs, known as G protein coupled receptor 41/free fatty acid receptor 3 (GPR41/FFAR3) and GPR43/FFAR2, are expressed in nasal tissue. Primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were stimulated with different concentrations of SCFAs to test induction of t-PA, which was analyzed by expression of mRNA and protein. Mediation of responses by SCFA receptors was evaluated by specific receptor gene silencing with siRNA.RESULTS: IHC study revealed that airway epithelial cells expressed GPR41 and GPR43. Acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid significantly induced t-PA expression from 2-10 folds. The strongest inducer of t-PA from NHBE cells was propionic acid; cells stimulated with propionic acid released t-PA into the supernatant in its active form. Gene silencing of GPR41 and GPR43 revealed that induction of t-PA by SCFAs was dependent upon both GPR41 and GPR43.CONCLUSIONS &amp; CLINICAL RELEVANCE: SCFAs were shown to induce airway epithelial cell expression of t-PA via GPR41 and GPR43.

Appetite Suppression and Altered Food Preferences Coincide with Changes in Appetite-Mediating Hormones During Energy Deficit at High Altitude, But Are Not Affected by Protein Intake. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2018.-Anorexia and unintentional body weight loss are common during high altitude (HA) sojourn, but underlying mechanisms are not fully characterized, and the impact of dietary macronutrient composition on appetite regulation at HA is unknown. This study aimed to determine the effects of a hypocaloric higher protein diet on perceived appetite and food preferences during HA sojourn and to examine longitudinal changes in perceived appetite, appetite mediating hormones, and food preferences during acclimatization and weight loss at HA. Following a 21-day level (SL) period, 17 unacclimatized males ascended to and resided at HA (4300<U+2009>m) for 22 days. At HA, participants were randomized to consume measured standard-protein (1.0<U+2009>g protein/kg/d) or higher protein (2.0<U+2009>g/kg/d) hypocaloric diets (45% carbohydrate, 30% energy restriction) and engaged in prescribed physical activity to induce an estimated 40% energy deficit. Appetite, food preferences, and appetite-mediating hormones were measured at SL and at the beginning and end of HA. Diet composition had no effect on any outcome. Relative to SL, appetite was lower during acute HA (days 0 and 1), but not different after acclimatization and weight loss (HA day 18), and food preferences indicated an increased preference for sweet- and low-protein foods during acute HA, but for high-fat foods after acclimatization and weight loss. Insulin, leptin, and cholecystokinin concentrations were elevated during acute HA, but not after acclimatization and weight loss, whereas acylated ghrelin concentrations were suppressed throughout HA. Findings suggest that appetite suppression and altered food preferences coincide with changes in appetite-mediating hormones during energy deficit at HA. Although dietary protein intake did not impact appetite, the possible incongruence with food preferences at HA warrants consideration when developing nutritional strategies for HA sojourn.","High altitude medicine &amp; biology",NA,NA

Around 90% of the proteins having published names likely function inside the cell, and nearly half of these intracellular proteins are associated with the endomembrane system. In a basic loss-of-function electrophysiological screen, we found that the disruption of eight (i.e., Rab5, CG32795, Mpcp, Tom70, vir-1, CG30427, Eaat1, and CG2781) of 28 randomly selected candidates affects olfactory responses in vivo. Thus, because this Orco interactome includes physiologically meaningful candidates, we anticipate that our platform will help guide further research on the molecular mechanisms of the insect odorant receptor family.","Molecules and cells",NA,NA

Unfortunately, during multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials, unexpected liver toxicity resulted in premature termination of its development. Here, we investigated whether TAK-875 directly inflicts toxicity on hepatocytes and explored its underlying mechanism of toxicity. TAK-875 decreased viability of 2D and 3D cultures of HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, in concentration- (&gt;50 µM) and time-dependent manners, both of which corresponded with ROS generation. An antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, attenuated TAK-875-mediated hepatotoxicity, which confirmed the role of ROS generation. Of note, knockdown of GPR40 using siRNA abolished the hepatotoxicity of TAK-875 and attenuated ROS generation. In contrast, TAK-875 induced no cytotoxicity in fibroblasts up to 500 µM. Supporting the hepatotoxic potential of TAK-875, exposure to TAK-875 resulted in increased mortality of zebrafish larvae at 25 µM. Histopathological examination of zebrafish exposed to TAK-875 revealed severe hepatotoxicity as manifested by degenerated hypertrophic hepatocytes with cytoplasmic vacuolation and acentric nuclei, confirming that TAK-875 may induce direct hepatotoxicity and that ROS generation may be involved in a GPR40-dependent manner.","Biomolecules &amp; therapeutics",NA,NA

The main purpose of this study was to gain an insight into distribution pattern of the NA1 genotype of group A RSV across the globe together with its evolutionary dynamics. We focused on the second hypervariable region of the G protein gene and used the same for Phylogenetic, Bayesian and Network analyses. Eighteen percent of the samples collected from 500 symptomatic pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) were found to be positive for RSV during 2011-15 from New Delhi, India. Of these, group B RSV was predominant and clustered into two different genotypes (BA and SAB4). Similarly, group A viruses clustered into two genotypes (NA1 and ON1). The data set from the group A viruses included 543 sequences from 23 different countries including 67 strains from India. The local evolutionary dynamics suggested consistent virus population of NA1 genotype in India during 2009 to 2014. The molecular clock analysis suggested that most recent common ancestor of group A and NA1 genotype have emerged in during the years 1953 and 2000, respectively. The global evolutionary rates of group A viruses and NA1 genotype were estimated to be 3.49<U+202F>×<U+202F>10<sup>-3</sup>(95% HPD, 2.90-4.17<U+202F>×<U+202F>10<sup>-3</sup>) and 3.56<U+202F>×<U+202F>10<sup>-3</sup>(95% HPD, 2.91<U+202F>×<U+202F>10<sup>-3</sup>-4.18<U+202F>×<U+202F>10<sup>-3</sup>) substitution/site/year, respectively. Analysis of the NA1 genotype of group A RSV reported during 11<U+202F>years i.e. from 2004 to 2014 showed its dominance in 21 different countries across the globe reflecting its evolutionary dynamics. The Network analysis showed highly intricate but an inconsistent pattern of haplotypes of NA1 genotype circulating in the world.

Knockdown of FPR1, but not knockdown of FPR3, blocked dTAT-WKYMVm-induced naïve CD4 T cell migration. Stimulation of naïve CD4 T cells with dTAT-WKYMVm elicited the activation of ERK, p38<U+202F>MAPK, and Akt.

"39","29425245","Unique pharmacological properties of serotonergic G-protein coupled receptors from cestodes.","BACKGROUND: Cestodes are a diverse group of parasites, some of them being agents of neglected diseases. In cestodes, little is known about the functional properties of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which have proved to be highly druggable targets in other organisms. Notably, serotonergic G-protein coupled receptors (5-HT GPCRs) play major roles in key functions like movement, development and reproduction in parasites.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three 5-HT GPCRs from Echinococcus granulosus and Mesocestoides corti were cloned, sequenced, bioinformatically analyzed and functionally characterized. Multiple sequence alignment with other GPCRs showed the presence of seven transmembrane segments and conserved motifs but interesting differences were also observed. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these new sequences within the 5-HT7 clade of GPCRs. Molecular modeling showed a striking resemblance in the spatial localization of key residues with their mammalian counterparts. Expression analysis using available RNAseq data showed that both E. granulosus sequences are expressed in larval and adult stages. Localization studies performed in E. granulosus larvae with a fluorescent probe produced a punctiform pattern concentrated in suckers. E. granulosus and M. corti larvae showed an increase in motility in response to serotonin. Heterologous expression revealed elevated levels of cAMP production in response to 5-HT and two of the GPCRs showed extremely high sensitivity to 5-HT (picomolar range). While each of these GPCRs was activated by 5-HT, they exhibit distinct pharmacological properties (5-HT sensitivity, differential responsiveness to ligands).SIGNIFICANCE: These data provide the first functional report of GPCRs in parasitic cestodes. The serotoninergic GPCRs characterized here may represent novel druggable targets for antiparasitic intervention.","PLoS neglected tropical diseases","12","2"

Accumulation of glycosphingolipids within peripheral nerves and/or dorsal root ganglia results in pain due to small-fiber neuropathy, which affects the majority of patients already in early childhood. The a-galactosidase A deficient mouse proved to be an adequate model for Fabry disease, as it shares many symptoms including altered temperature sensitivity and pain perception. To characterize the signatures of gene expression that might underlie Fabry disease-associated sensory deficits and pain, we performed one-color based hybridization microarray expression profiling of DRG explants from adult a-galactosidase A deficient mice and age-matched wildtype controls. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and pathway analyses were performed for differentially regulated mRNAs. We found 812 differentially expressed genes between adult a-galactosidase A deficient mice and age-matched wildtype controls, 506 of them being upregulated, and 306 being downregulated. Among the enriched pathways and processes, the disease-specific pathways &quot;lysosome&quot; and &quot;ceramide metabolic process&quot; were identified, enhancing reliability of the current analysis. Novel pathways that we identified include &quot;G-protein coupled receptor signaling&quot; and &quot;retrograde transport&quot; for the upregulated genes. From the analysis of downregulated genes, immune-related pathways, autoimmune, and infection pathways emerged. The current analysis is the first to present a differential gene expression profile of DRGs from a-galactosidase A deficient mice, thereby providing knowledge on possible mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain related symptoms in Fabry patients.

The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1, also known as GPR30) is considered a novel therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we demonstrated that hippocampal GPR30 expression was reduced in middle-aged mice compared with young adult mice. GPR30 agonist G1 improved both fear and spatial memory in both male and female middle-aged mice, but not in young adult mice, which were blocked by the GPR30 antagonist G15. Interestingly, a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG)-induced long-term depression (LTD) in mossy fiber-cornu ammonis 3 (MF-CA3) synapses but not Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) synapses was facilitated in brain slices from G1-treated middle-aged mice. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in SC-CA1 synapses was not affected in slices from G1-treated mice. The effects of GPR30 activation on memory and DHPG-LTD in MF-CA3 synapses were further confirmed by viral expression of GPR30 in the CA3. The regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by G1 treatment might be related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling, as G15 also blocked G1-induced activation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway. Moreover, we found that DHPG triggered GluA internalization in slices from G1-treated mice but not control mice. Pharmacological experiments showed that G1-mediated facilitation of DHPG-induced LTD in MF-CA3 synapses was dependent on protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor), and TrkB signaling. In conclusion, our results indicate that GPR30 activation improves memory in middle-aged mice, likely through facilitating synaptic plasticity in the CA3. This study provides novel evidence that GPR30 activation can improve memory in middle-aged animals.","Neurobiology of learning and memory","149",NA

SPMs, including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are endogenous lipid mediators generated from <U+03C9>-6 arachidonic acid or <U+03C9>-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids during the resolution phase of acute inflammation. They have potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving actions in various inflammatory disorders. Due to the potent proresolving and anti-inflammatory effects, SPMs are also used for pain relief. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which SPMs act on their respective G-protein-coupled receptors in immune cells and nerve cells to normalize pain via regulating inflammatory mediators, transient receptor potential ion channels, and central sensitization.

Employing this animal model it was revealed that this Cxcl12 signalling system plays a crucial role for directed migration of primordial germ cells (PGC) during early testicular development. Importantly, subsequent studies indicated that this regulatory mechanism is evolutionarily conserved also in mice. What is more, the functional role of the CXCL12 system does not seem to be limited to early phases of testicular development. Data from mouse studies rather demonstrate that CXCL12 and its receptors are also involved in the homing process of gonocytes into their niches at the basal membrane of the seminiferous tubules. Intriguingly, even the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) present in the adult mouse testis appear to maintain the ability to migrate towards a CXCL12 gradient as demonstrated by functional in vitro migration assays and in vivo germ cell transplantation assays. These findings not only indicate a role of the CXCL12 system throughout male germ cell development in mice but also suggest that this system may be evolutionarily conserved. In this review we take into account the available literature focusing on the localization patterns of the CXCL12 system not only in rodents but also in primates, including the human. Based on these data we discuss whether the CXCL12 system is also conserved between rodents and primates and discuss the known and potential functional consequences.","Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",NA,NA

PHP1B is an imprinting disorder that results from loss of methylation at the maternal GNAS gene, which suppresses transcription of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein of the PTH receptor. Emerging evidence supports an association between assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and imprinting disorders; however, there is currently little evidence linking PHP1B and ART. We present a twin boy conceived by ART to parents with no history of subfertility who presented at age 12 with bilateral slipped capital femoral epiphysis and bilateral genu valgum deformity. Clinical and laboratory investigation revealed markedly elevated PTH, low ionized calcium, elevated phosphorus, TSH resistance, and skeletal evidence of hyperparathyroidism, leading to the diagnosis of PHP1B. A partial loss of methylation at the GNAS exon A/B locus was observed. The patient's dizygotic twin sibling was asymptomatic and had normal laboratory evaluation.

In this study, we demonstrated that exogenous MxA expression in the Huh7 and Huh7.5.1 hepatoma cell lines significantly decreased the levels of HCV RNA and core proteins, whereas MxA knockdown exerted the opposite effect. MxA-mediated inhibition of HCV replication was found to involve the JAK-STAT pathway: STAT1 phosphorylation and the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as guanylate-binding protein 1 and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 were augmented by MxA overexpression and reduced by endogenous MxA silencing. Treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib abrogated the MxA-mediated suppression of HCV replication and activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Additionally, transfection with an MxA mutant with disrupted GTP-binding consensus motifs abrogated activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and resistance to HCV replication. This study shows that MxA inhibits HCV replication by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway through a mechanism involving its GTPase function.","Archives of virology",NA,NA

Total proteins of the left ventricle were extracted and quantitatively analyzed by isobaric tags using relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technologies.

Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the most enriched molecular function category terms were binding, including calcium ion biding, GTP binding, actin binding and lipid binding. The expression levels of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and its related proteins were increased in both left ventricular tissue and H9C2 cells after ischemia-hypoxia.

To gain novel insights into the role of GPx2, proteomic profiles of colonic tissues either derived from wild type (WT) or GPx2 knockout (KO) mice, maintained under selenium (Se) deficiency or adequate Se supplementation conditions were established and analyzed. Amongst the panel of differentially expressed proteins, the calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) was significantly down-regulated in GPx2 KO versus WT mice regardless of the given Se status. Moreover, transcript levels of the isoforms CLCA2 and CLCA3 showed a similar expression pattern. In the intestine, CLCA1 is usually restricted to mucin-producing goblet cells. However, although -SeKO mice had the highest numbers of goblet cells as confirmed by significantly enhanced mRNA expression levels of the goblet cell marker mucin-2, the observed expression pattern suggests that GPx2 KO goblet cells might be limited in synthesizing CLCA1. Furthermore, transcript levels of differentiation markers such as chromogranin-1 (Chga) for enteroendocrine cells and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) for stem cells were also downregulated in GPx2 KO mice. Moreover, this was accompanied by a downregulation of the mRNA expression levels of the intestinal hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (Glp1), ghrelin (Ghrl) and somatostatin (Sst). Thus, it seems that GPx2 might be important for the modulation of cell fate decisions in the murine intestinal epithelium.","Oncotarget","9","1"

"61","29416044","A small molecule inhibitor of Rheb selectively targets mTORC1 signaling.","The small G-protein Rheb activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in response to growth factor signals. mTORC1 is a master regulator of cellular growth and metabolism; aberrant mTORC1 signaling is associated with fibrotic, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and rare disorders. Point mutations in the Rheb switch II domain impair its ability to activate mTORC1. Here, we report the discovery of a small molecule (NR1) that binds Rheb in the switch II domain and selectively blocks mTORC1 signaling. NR1 potently inhibits mTORC1 driven phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) but does not inhibit phosphorylation of AKT or ERK. In contrast to rapamycin, NR1 does not cause inhibition of mTORC2 upon prolonged treatment. Furthermore, NR1 potently and selectively inhibits mTORC1 in mouse kidney and muscle in vivo. The data presented herein suggest that pharmacological inhibition of Rheb is an effective approach for selective inhibition of mTORC1 with therapeutic potential.","Nature communications","9","1"

Recent studies showed that FOXL2 is expressed in human and bovine endometrium and that its levels fluctuate during pregnancy. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the expression and function of FOXL2 in embryo implantation.METHODS: Mouse uteri at different days of pregnancy were isolated and analyzed for the expression and localization of FOXL2. A lentiviral strategy was further employed to either knockdown or overexpress FOXL2 in non-receptive human endometrial AN3-CA cells and in receptive Ishikawa cells, respectively. These genetically modified cells were compared to cells infected with a control lentivirus to determine the function of FOXL2 in trophectoderm cells adherence to Endometrial Epithelium was associated with the expression of genes known to be involved in acquisition of uterine receptivity.RESULTS: We report that FOXL2 is expressed in both, the luminal epithelium and the myometrium of the mouse uterus and that its expression declines prior to implantation. We found that endometrial cells expressing low FOXL2 levels, either endogenous or genetically manipulated, were associated with a higher attachment rate of mouse blastocysts or human Jeg3 spheroids and mouse blastocysts. In accordance, low-FOXL2 levels were associated with changes in the expression level of components of the Wnt/Fzd and apoptotic pathways, both of which are involved in uterine receptivity. Furthermore, FOXL2 expression was inversely correlated with G-protein signaling protein 2 (Rgs2) and cytokine expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FOXL2 interferes with embryo attachment. Better understanding of the function of FOXL2 in the uterus would possibly suggest novel strategies for treatment of infertility attributed to repeated implantation failure.","Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&amp;E","16","1"

Exercise training activates kynurenine biotransformation in skeletal muscle, which protects from neuroinflammation and leads to peripheral kynurenic acid accumulation. Here we show that kynurenic acid increases energy utilization by activating G protein-coupled receptor Gpr35, which stimulates lipid metabolism, thermogenic, and anti-inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue. This suppresses weight gain in animals fed a high-fat diet and improves glucose tolerance. Kynurenic acid and Gpr35 enhance Pgc-1a1 expression and cellular respiration, and increase the levels of Rgs14 in adipocytes, which leads to enhanced beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Conversely, genetic deletion of Gpr35 causes progressive weight gain and glucose intolerance, and sensitizes to the effects of high-fat diets. Finally, exercise-induced adipose tissue browning is compromised in Gpr35 knockout animals. This work uncovers kynurenine metabolism as a pathway with therapeutic potential to control energy homeostasis.","Cell metabolism","27","2"

Extracellular proteolytic processing of chemerin generates a spectrum of isoforms that differ significantly with respect to the ability to activate the cognate receptors chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) and G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1). Increased total serum chemerin has been widely reported in obese humans as well as in preclinical rodent models of adiposity. However, very little information is available regarding the correspondence, if any, of changes in total serum chemerin protein with chemerin bioactivity.METHODS: Total serum chemerin and ex vivo CMKLR1 and GPR1 activation was compared using two widely used murine obesity models: high fat diet feeding (HFD) and leptin deficiency (ob/ob).RESULTS: Total serum chemerin levels and ex vivo CMKLR1 and GPR1 activation were significantly induced in HFD. The bioactivity ratio (bioactive chemerin/total chemerin) was also increased when measured with CMKLR1, but not GPR1. In contrast, while ob/ob mice exhibited increased total serum chemerin protein, ex vivo receptor activation was observed with GPR1, but not CMKLR1. There was no change in bioactivity ratio for either receptor. Of note, GPR1 but not CMKLR1 bioactivity positively correlated with adipose tissue inflammation.CONCLUSIONS: While increased total serum chemerin is a consistent finding among rodent obesity models, this may not accurately reflect changes in chemerin bioactivity which is the major determinant of biological effects.","Cytokine","104",NA

One of the ISG Mx, encodes type I interferon inducible GTPase that is responsible for the establishment of an anti-viral state within cells. Intriguingly, several isoforms of Mx have been reported in fish, but the structural analysis of fish Mx proteins remains unexplored. For the first time, we have identified and unraveled the molecular structure of Mx protein from Indian snow trout, Schizothorax richardsonii (Gray) a Coldwater fish that inhabits the water bodies in the sub-Himalayan region. The snow trout Mx coding region consists of 2518 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1854 nucleotides. It codes for a polypeptide of 617 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 70<U+202F>kDa. In silico analysis of snow trout Mx protein revealed signature of dynamin family (LPRGTGIVTR) along with a tripartite GTP-binding domain (GDQSSGKS, DLPG, and TKPD). Homology modelling established that the Mx protein is an elongated structure with a G domain, bundle signaling element (BSE) and a GTPase effector domain (GED). Moreover, the GED of Mx contains two highly conserved leucine zippers at the COOH-terminal of the protein suggesting its structural similarity with human homologues. However, snow trout Mx lacks the essential features of its mammalian homologues questioning its functional characteristics. Further, a ligand binding site in the said protein has also been predicted adjacent to the GTPase switch within the G domain.","Computational biology and chemistry","73",NA

Soon after its discovery, ghrelin was found to increase body weight and adiposity by acting on the hypothalamic melanocortinergic system. Subsequently, ghrelin was found to exert a series of metabolic effects, overall testifying ghrelin a pleiotropic nature of broad pharmacological interest. Ghrelin acts through the growth hormone secretagogue-receptor (GHS-R), a seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor with high expression in the anterior pituitary, pancreatic islets, thyroid gland, heart and various regions of the brain. Among ghrelins numerous metabolic effects are the most prominent the stimulation of appetite via activation of orexigenic hypothalamic neurocircuits and the food-intake independent stimulation of lipogenesis, which both together lead to an increase in body weight and adiposity. Ghrelin effects beyond the regulation of appetite and GH secretion include the regulation of gut motility, sleep-wake rhythm, taste sensation, reward seeking behaviour, and the regulation of glucose metabolism. The latter received recently increasing recognition because pharmacological inhibition of ghrelin signaling might be of therapeutic value to improve insuin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this review we highlight the multifaceted nature of ghrelin and summarize its glucoregulatory action and discuss the pharmacological value of ghrelin pathway inhibition for the treatment of glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes.","Peptides","100",NA

Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) plays a key role in maintaining blood glucose levels within normal range. Impaired GSIS has been associated with type 2 diabetes, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (cysLT1R) is an important G protein-coupled receptor mediating the biological functions of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs). Little is known about the effects of cysLT1R in insulin secretion and pathogenesis of T2DM. In the present study, we aimed to define the physiological functions of cysLT1R in GSIS in MIN6 ß-cells. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis, we found that cysLT1R was expressed in pancreatic MIN6 ß-cells. We also reported that glucose increased the expression of cysLT1R in MIN6 cells. Additionally, the cysLT1R antagonist montelukast promoted GSIS in a dose dependent manner, however, the cysLT1R agonist LD4 inhibited GSIS, suggesting an antagonistic effect of cysLT1R on GSIS. Silencing of cysLT1R by transfection with cysLT1R siRNA enhanced GSIS while overexpression of cysLT1R reduced GSIS in pancreatic MIN6 ß-cells. Mechanistically, we found that the Arf6/Cdc42/Rac1 pathway was involved in this process. Collectively, our findings highlight the essential role of cysLT1R in suppressing pancreatic insulin secretion, and potentially provided a new insight into understanding the mechanical regulation of glucose homeostasis.","Cellular signalling",NA,NA

However, there is insufficient, direct structural evidence of the structure, dynamics and the mechanism of function of this receptor. Cholesterol plays an important role in the function of many GPCRs and reduced cholesterol levels may be linked to serotonergic pathway disruptions. But cholesterol's effect on the structure, especially the oligomeric states of the 5HT2A receptor is not well understood. Structural studies on most GPCRs typically require the substitution of the dynamic intracellular loop 3 along with other mutations and truncations for stability and hence, structural characterization of native receptor sequence is relatively rare. Here we have cloned, over-expressed and purified native sequence of rat serotonin 5HT2A GPCR using baculoviral expression system. Subsequently, we used cryo-electron microscopy to show that the 5HT2A GPCR forms a dimer in presence of cholesterol but converts to a monomer when cholesterol is depleted. Since dimer formation is necessary for signaling by 5HT2A receptors, our results also indicate the importance of cholesterol in serotonin 5HT2A receptor's function.","Protein and peptide letters",NA,NA

"75","29410984","The role of water molecules in phototransduction of retinal proteins and G protein-coupled receptors.","G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a key family of membrane proteins in all eukaryotes and also very important drug targets for medical intervention. The extensively studied visual pigment rhodopsin is a prime example of a family A GPCR. Its chromophore ligand retinal is covalently linked to a lysine in helix seven forming a protonated Schiff base. Interestingly, this is the same situation in other-non-GPCR-retinal proteins, like the prototype light-driven microbial proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, albeit there is no (or only a very remote) phylogenetical link. Close to the retinal ligand, several water molecules help to organise a functionally important hydrogen bond network that undergoes significant changes during photo-activation. Such water-mediated networks are also critical for ligand binding of other GPCRs and they are becoming increasingly important in drug discovery. GPCRs also contain a partially conserved water mediated hydrogen bond network that stabilises the ground state of the receptor, and rearrangement of this network leads to the stabilization of the active state. Some water molecules have a specific role in this process to appropriately orient specific residues relative to the Schiff base, and to modulate the fine structure of the transmembrane bundle, particularly near the intracellular G protein binding site. While the atomic details of these mechanisms are still missing, the recent developments in free electron lasers (FELs) are enabling us to begin to observe the changes in waters and relevant side chains shortly after photo activation at an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal resolution.","Faraday discussions",NA,NA

Recently, GRPR/NMBR are receiving considerable attention because they act as growth factor receptors often in an autocrine manner in different lung-cancers, affect tumor angiogenesis, their inhibition increases the cytotoxic potency of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors reducing lung-cancer cellular resistance/survival and their overexpression can be used for sensitive tumor localization as well as to target cytotoxic agents to the cancer. The orphan BRS-3-receptor, because of homology is classified as a bombesin receptor but has received little attention, despite the fact that it is also reported in a number of studies in lung-cancer cells and has growth effects in these cells. To address its potential importance, in this study, we examined the frequency/relative quantitative expression of human BRS-3 compared to GRPR/NMBR and the effects of its activation on cell-signaling/growth in 13 different human lung-cancer cell-lines. Our results showed that BRS-3 receptor is expressed in 92% of the cell-lines and that it is functional in these cells, because its activation stimulates phospholipase-C with breakdown of phosphoinositides and changes in cytosolic calcium, stimulates ERK/MAPK and stimulates cell growth by EGFR transactivation in some, but not all, the lung-cancer cell-lines. These results suggest that human BRS-3, similar to GRPR/NMBR, is frequently ectopically-expressed by lung-cancer cells in which, it is functional, affecting cell signaling/growth. These results suggest that similar to GRPR/NMBR, BRS-3 should receive increased attention as possible approach for the development of novel treatments and/or diagnosis in lung-cancer.","Peptides","101",NA

In this paper, one kind of GPCRs were identified from Penaeus monodon, called PmGPCR, included an open reading frame (ORF) of 1113 bp. Bioinformatic analysis showed that PmGPCR protein had the typical structure of seven transmembrane domains (7TM), especially the special Asp-Arg-Try motif (DRY motif) between the third transmembrane structures (TM3) and the second intracellular loops (IL-2) which can prove that PmGPCR belongs to the rhodopsin-like family. The analyses of phylogenetic tree indicated that the amino acid sequence of PmGPCR should be merged into Procambarus clarkiic with high identity (98%). Quantitative real-time PCR (q RT-PCR) revealed that PmGPCR mRNA was highly expressed in hepatopancreas, abdominal ganglia and lymph, in which it was significantly higher than that of other tissues (P<U+202F>&lt;<U+202F>0.05). In addition, the expression of PmGPCR was analyzed during three days post-stimulation with the gram-positive/negative bacteria, the mRNA expression level increased after challenged with gram - positive bacteria in hepatopancreas, lymph and intestines. During the development stages, PmGPCR showed significantly higher expression in nauplius, zoea III, mysis III and post larvae stages than that in other development stages. Meanwhile, the highest transcripts expression of PmGPCR in abdominal ganglia, hepatopancreas, lymph and intestines respectively appeared at D0, D1, D2 and D3/D4 stages of molting. High or low concentration of ammonia nitrogen up-regulated the expression level of PmGPCR at the initial stage in hepatopancreas and gill, and then down-regulated at 48<U+202F>h.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play key roles in synaptic plasticity by strengthening or weakening synapses and/or shaping dendritic spines. While most studies of synaptic plasticity have focused on cell surface receptors and their downstream signaling partners, emerging data point to a critical new role for the very same receptors to signal from inside the cell. Intracellular receptors have been localized to nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and mitochondria. From these intracellular positions, such receptors may couple to different signaling systems, display unique desensitization patterns and/or exhibit distinct patterns of subcellular distribution. Intracellular GPCRs can be activated at the cell surface, endocytosed and transported to an intracellular site or simply activated in situ by de novo ligand synthesis, diffusion of permeable ligands or active transport of nonpermeable ligands. Current <U+FB01>ndings reinforce the notion that intracellular GPCRs play a dynamic role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory.

Previously, we showed that transcription factor Gata4 acts as a master regulator controlling LSEC differentiation. Upon analysis of the molecular signature of LSEC, we identified GPR182 as a potential LSEC-specific orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Here, we demonstrate that GPR182 is expressed by LSEC and by EC with sinusoidal differentiation in spleen, lymph node and bone marrow in healthy human tissues. In a tissue microarray analysis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, endothelial GPR182 expression was significantly reduced in tumor samples compared to peritumoral liver tissue samples (p<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.0105). Loss of endothelial GPR182 expression was also seen in fibrotic and cirrhotic liver tissues. In vitro, GPR182 differentially regulated canonical GPCR signaling pathways as shown using reporter luciferase assays in HEK293T cells. Whereas ERK and RhoA signaling were inhibited, CREB and Calcium signaling were activated by ectopic GPR182 overexpression.

Axons of OSNs that express a given OR coalesce into homogeneous glomeruli, which reside at conserved positions in the olfactory bulb. ORs are intimately involved in ensuring the expression of one OR per OSN and the coalescence of OSN axons into glomeruli. But the mechanisms whereby ORs accomplish these diverse functions remain poorly understood. An experimental approach that has been informative is to substitute an OR genetically with another GPCR that is normally not expressed in OSNs, in order to determine in which aspects this GPCR can serve as surrogate OR in mouse OSNs. Thus far only the ß2-adrenergic receptor (ß2AR, Ardb2) has been shown to be able to serve as surrogate OR in OSNs; the ß2AR could substitute for the M71 OR in all aspects examined. Can other non-olfactory GPCRs function equally well as surrogate ORs in OSNs? Here, we have generated and characterized two novel gene-targeted mouse strains in which the mouse melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r) or the mouse dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1a) is coexpressed with tauGFP in OSNs that express the OR locus M71. These alleles and strains are abbreviated as Mc4r<U+202F><U+2192><U+202F>M71-GFP and Drd1a<U+202F><U+2192><U+202F>M71-GFP. We detected strong Mc4r or Drd1a immunoreactivity in axons and dendritic knobs and cilia of OSNs that express Mc4r or Drd1a from the M71 locus. These OSNs responded physiologically to cognate agonists for Mc4r (Ro27-3225) or Drd1a (SKF81297), and not to the M71 ligand acetophenone. Axons of OSNs expressing Mc4r<U+202F><U+2192><U+202F>M71-GFP coalesced into glomeruli. Axons of OSNs expressing Drd1a<U+202F><U+2192><U+202F>M71-GFP converged onto restricted areas of the olfactory bulb but did not coalesce into glomeruli. Thus, OR functions in OSNs can be substituted by Mc4r or Drd1a, but not as well as by ß2AR. We attribute the weak performance of Drd1a as surrogate OR to poor OSN maturation.","Molecular and cellular neurosciences","88",NA

The present study examined cellular protective effects of new 17ß-E analogs and 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) analogs with no or little oestrogen activity. 17ß-E, 17a-E, 2-ME, and an antagonist of the G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor (GPER), G36, were also included. Both 17a-E and 2-ME protected against deprivation-induced cell death in PC12 cells at 1<U+2009>nM, but they enhanced the deprivation-induced cell death accompanied by caspase 3 activity and decreased intracellular GSH levels during deprivation at 10<U+2009>µM. In addition, 10<U+2009>µM 17a-E activated the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, which was linked to the enhanced death and reduced GSH levels. Analogs of 2-ME modified with a 6-isoquinoline moiety (6iq) protected against deprivation-induced cell death at 1<U+2009>nM and did not interfere with the GSH levels nor increase p38 protein levels at 10<U+2009>µM. The promoter activity of the catalytic subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC) in GSH synthesis as well as protein levels of GCLC and Nrf2, increased with the 2-ME analogs at 10<U+2009>µM. In conclusion, the steroids have differential protective effects, and modifying 2-ME may give the steroid more favourable properties than 17a-E, 2-ME, and G36 in regard to GSH regulation.","Free radical research",NA,NA
"92","29405001","Mapping of Protein Interfaces in Live Cells Using Genetically Encoded Crosslinkers.","Understanding the topology of protein-protein interactions is a matter of fundamental importance in the biomedical field. Biophysical approaches such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance can investigate in detail only isolated protein complexes that are reconstituted in an artificial environment. Alternative methods are needed to investigate protein interactions in a physiological context, as well as to characterize protein complexes that elude the direct structural characterization. We describe here a general strategy to investigate protein interactions at the molecular level directly in the live mammalian cell, which is based on the genetic incorporation of photo- and chemical crosslinking noncanonical amino acids. First a photo-crosslinking amino acid is used to map putative interaction surfaces and determine which positions of a protein come into proximity of an associated partner. In a second step, the subset of residues that belong to the binding interface are substituted with a chemical crosslinker that reacts selectively with proximal cysteines strategically placed in the interaction partner. This allows determining inter-molecular spatial constraints that provide the basis for building accurate molecular models. In this chapter, we illustrate the detailed application of this experimental strategy to unravel the binding modus of the 40-mer neuropeptide hormone Urocortin1 to its class B G-protein coupled receptor, the corticotropin releasing factor receptor type 1. The approach is in principle applicable to any protein complex independent of protein type and size, employs established techniques of noncanonical amino acid mutagenesis, and is feasible in any molecular biology laboratory.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","1728",NA

G protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124), an orphan receptor in the adhesion GPCR subfamily, promotes angiogenesis in the brain. In the present study, we explored the role of endothelial GPR124 in the development and progression of atherosclerosis in adult mice.METHODS: Using tetracycline-inducible transgenic systems, we generated mice expressing GPR124 specifically under control of the Tie-2 promoter. The animal model of atherosclerosis was constructed by intravenously injecting AAV-PCSK9DY into tetracycline-regulated mice and feeding the mice a high-fat diet for 16 consecutive weeks. Biochemical analysis and immunohistochemistry methods were used to address the role and mechanism of GPR124 in the pathological process of atherosclerosis.RESULTS: Higher TC (total cholesterol) and LDL-C (low density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels in serum and greater lipid deposition in the aortic sinus were found in atherosclerotic mice with GPR124 overexpression, coincident with the elevated proliferation of smooth muscle cells. We observed an elevation of ONOO- in the aortic sinus in this model by using immunofluorescence, and the experiments showed that the specific overexpression of GPR124 in the endothelium induced the up-regulation of CD68, NLRP3 and caspase-1 levels in the aortic sinus.CONCLUSION: The above results indicate that manipulating GPR124 in the endothelium may contribute to delayed pathological progression of atherosclerosis.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology","45","2"

The animals were divided into two groups according to random number table (n = 8). In the mild hypothermia group, the blood temperature of the animals was induced to 33 centigrade and maintained for 6 hours within 20 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) by using a hypothermia therapeutic apparatus. In the control group, the body temperature of the animals was maintained at (38.0±0.5)centigrade with cold and warm blankets. The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), the maximum rate of increase or decrease in left rentricular pressure (+dp/dt max) were measured during the course of the experiment. The cardiac output (CO) was measured by heat dilution methods before CA (baseline), and 0.5, 1, 3, 6 hours after ROSC respectively, the venous blood was collected to detect the concentration of cTnI. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured with cardiac ultrasound before CA and 6 hours after ROSC. Animals were sacrificed at 6 hours after ROSC and the myocardial tissue was harvested quickly, the mRNA expression of ß1-AR in myocardium was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the contents of adenylate cyclase (AC) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the protein content of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was detected by Western Blot.CONCLUSIONS: Mild hypothermia can reduce the degree of cardiac function injury after CPR, and its mechanism may be related to the reduction of impaired myocardial ß-AR signaling after CPR.","Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue","30","2"

Specific pathogen-free, wild-type mice were fed either a control diet (CD) or a high-fat, high-sucrose WD after weaning and were euthanized at 10 mo of age to study the pathways that affect cognitive health. The results showed that long-term WD intake reduced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the brain and isolated microglia. A WD also activated ERK1/2 and reduced postsynaptic density-95 in the brain, suggesting postsynaptic damage. Moreover, WD-fed mice had increased inflammatory signaling in the brain, ileum, liver, adipose tissue, and spleen, which was accompanied by microglia activation. In the brain, as well as in the digestive tract, a WD reduced signaling regulated by retinoic acid and bile acids (BAs), whose receptors form heterodimers to control metabolism and inflammation. Furthermore, a WD intake caused dysbiosis and dysregulated BA synthesis with reduced endogenous ligands for BA receptors, i.e., farnesoid X receptor and G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor in the liver and brain. Together, dysregulated BA synthesis and dysbiosis were accompanied by systemic inflammation, microglial activation, and reduced neuroplasticity induced by WD.-Jena, P. K., Sheng, L., Di Lucente, J., Jin, L.-W., Maezawa, I., Wan, Y.-J. Y.
